"You can get a huge amount of the environmental and health benefits from just cutting out red meat.

For example, the carbon footprint per person of the following diets:

* Meat Lover: 3.3
* Average: 2.5
* No Beef: 1.9
* Vegetarian: 1.7
* Vegan: 1.5

The difference between Average and Vegetarian is 0.8, but you can get 0.6 better than Average just by cutting out Beef.  Going from ""No Beef"" all the way to fully Vegan only has an additional 0.4 benefit, so the biggest and easiest improvement to your diets carbon  footprint is just cutting out the red meat.

"I've heard this term recently and it is what I have been doing for about 8ish months. I on average eat meat (generally poultry or fish) 2-3 times a week. Red meat I try to do once a month at most.

Whenever people asked me my diet I have always just said ""I eat mostly vegetarian, and Vegan when I can but meat sometimes."" I feel like saying ""flexitarian"" would still end up in this explanation tbh.

The way I view meat is that is a luxury. I do not need it to survive in anyway, and I am very against the cruelty behind the industry.

"Can't we just call this ""Default"" instead of giving it a stupid fucking name for something that has been the standard since God or Allah or Steven Hawking's ghost created omnivores on this planet? 

Like, that's literally called a human diet. Meat when available and substitute the rest with vegetables and plants. I can't use the word ""literally"" enough, that's literally how any meat/plant eating animal works, you eat meat once in a while or less often than plants. Humans would eat meat once or twice a week and the rest of the time is a protein/fiber/plant rich diet until meat is available. 

The opposite of this is called the ""American Diet"", where you eat meat because it's cheaper than broccoli. It's cheaper to buy a whole burger than a side salad with 1 piece of tomato. There's a big difference between meat eaters and Americans. Americans are sick because food is a product, not a basic human right. Guns are, but health and food and clean water are not, but at least we have guns to protect our right to.. oh wait, nvm.

"I am basically this. I don't get people who parade the fact that they have gone full vegan or full meat. I don't care. Eat what you want, man. Food is good whether vegetarian or full meat. However, I would say that in the interest of the environment and meat quality, its best to cut back and not force the kinds of economies of scale that poultry farmers, shephards or cow farmers use to produce beef, pork and chicken. It's best to cut back from the perpsective of meat quality, animal welfare and the environment. 

It's a win-win cos you get good meat when you want it. Animals don't get to live in tiny coops which makes the overall meat richer and provides greater quality to the meat. And finally, since there aren't a whole lot of animals now, we reduce the methane emissions and energy consumption that meat production takes up right now.

"I think this is totally the way to go. I started dating a girl who's strictly vegetarian, and often poked fun at her in the beginning because I had always been a meat and potatoes kind of guy.  I wanted to impress her, and I really enjoy cooking, so I figured I could get two birds stoned at once and make vegetarian food that actually tasted good.  This soon became a fun cooking challenge for me. I then realized I felt pretty damn good after eating these meals, not so similar to the meat sweat naps after eating a big steak dinner.  Two years later I've gone from eating meat with literally every meal of the day, to eating meat 5-6 meals a week tops. I really enjoy vegetarian food and experimenting with it in the kitchen, and now fully support those who are vegetarian/vegan, but know that it isn't right for me.

* pissing off vegans by telling people it's ok to have meat, just as long as 95% of your calaries come from plants that are minimally-processed (for example, brown rice = good, rice crackers from a cellophane bag = bad).

* losing weight without really trying. I'd lose more if I exercised, but....

All of the supposed benefits of veganism are consistent with reduced meat consumption/production. The environment can support sustainable agriculture. (I'm aware that's a tautology) There are healthy animal-based products, so veganism isn't necessary for health reasons either. 

Strict veganism isn't consistent with environmentalism or public health. If such a philosophy were, it would accept animal products farmed ethically and consumed efficiently. Not accepting these practices is only consistent with a person who's feelings get hurt when they think about an animal dying. It's not a morally or ethically wrong mindset, but it's useless for the purpose of improving our societies.

"My girlfriend and I have taken up this approach. We started by cooking 1 dinner per week meat free. After a while we built up enough tried and tested recipes to go two meals per week. Our breakfasts are also meat free, which is pretty easy, and I eat leftovers for lunch. In total we eat a minimum of 10/15 meals meat free in a working week.

Also, a bit of advice for people looking for meat-free meals; Make dishes that are intended to be meat-free like; shakshuka, ratatouille, soups, stuffed peppers, curry chickpeas, etc. Don't make meat dishes sans-meat, or use meat substitutes.

"I guess you could consider me a ""flexitarian"". I was a vegetarian for a little over a year. I ended up going to a Chinese buffet and just saying fuck it one day. I still eat mainly vegetarian but I have meat from time to time. I feel like this is probably the best approach for long term change. I always felt I was labeled as ""that vegetarian guy"". I certainly was, but I constantly had to justify myself as I live in an area where being vegetarian is not too common.

In a way its the best of both worlds, I can eat whatever I want, which is mainly vegetarian, and I can still occasionally have meat. The worst part about being vegetarian/vegan is going out to family or work gatherings and having people offer you food, and you have to turn them down.

"I started eating plant based about a year ago. It's been a great journey, I love it. People think it's very restrictive but the only issues I run into are during social occasions. My grocery bill is cheaper, my inflammation markers (IBD) are doing a lot better, I feel better. The only downside is when I want to go out with friends and the restaurants only semi-plant based option is french fries or nachos with no meat/cheese.

I mean, I'm a conscious consumer and I'm not going out buying beaver pelts or leather coats but I'm far from vegan. You can also eat like garbage as a vegan.

I hate words like this. I don't label my diet, it's just what I do. I'm not different than other people that choose to eat meat or choose not to eat meat for ethical reasons. It's just my lifestyle.

"I follow a flexitarian diet. My approach is that I eat meat when someone offers it to me such as when I am a guest at a friend’s home or during the holidays. I think if the food has already been prepared then it is a kind gesture to accept it as a guest and I don’t like the idea of food going to waste. 

I also eat meat when I travel although I do try to do research about the naturally vegetarian or vegan options of a particular culture or region. I eat meat every once in a while out of the blue when I crave it. I usually crave it when I am really really hungry and just want something to eat. Most of the time after I eat it I am a little disappointed because it is never as good as I remember or expect it to be.  Also after I eat it my digestion feels sluggish and that also puts me off. 

When I go to specific events where there is fun junk food that I don’t usually eat such as a hot dog at a baseball game, sometimes I will just go for it because it feels like part of the experience. 

I think it is easier for me to take this approach because my motivations for not eating meat are for the environment and for my health mostly. I understand it wouldn’t necessarily make as much sense for someone that doesn’t eat meat for moral reasons.

"I was vegan from 1989 until 2004. I worked in an office next to a really wonderful Chinese buffet and at that point started eating fish again, simply because it was a good cheap lunch. After that I brought in and out and started eating whatever was available or offered, and really began to enjoy eating in restaurants again.

Time passed and I develop some health issues, namely elevated blood sugar levels and the doctor suggested I needed to drop potatoes corn sugar and rice from my diet. Since I already didn't consume any detectable amounts of sugar, the rest was a matter of mental adjustment. I gave up all those starchy carbs, every starch pretty much except for legumes, about 2 1/2 years ago.

Just this month I have gone vegan again, although this time of course the starchy carbs are still out. It hasn't been all that difficult, but if I visit with family and they are serving something that isn't vegan, I may eat a little of it. No sense in being rude, the animal is already dad, and a little bacon or eggs or whatever here or there isn't going to kill me. And I still do need a source of natural B 12.

So I consider myself a starch free vegan with no Nazi vegan attitude.

"Honestly, I’m not really a fan of the term ‘vegan’ either. I think inventing this term was a mistake because it takes focus away from the oppressors and puts it on the non-oppressors. Usually the oppressors are the ones with a label: racist, rapist, pedophile, sexist etc. These terms put the focus on the problem, where it should be.

I completely agree with Maisie William’s quote: “We should stop calling feminists ‘feminists’ and just start calling people who aren't feminist ‘sexist’.” Same goes for the term vegan, we should stop calling vegans ""vegans"" and just start calling people who aren't vegan ""carnist"".

I think that would’ve cleared up a lot of confusion and would render the term flexitarian even more useless than it already is. Even vegetarians would fall under the term carnist.

"I actually disagree, and I'll explain why.

While being a flexitarian is not, by any means, enough to combat the injustices that are carried out, having a stepping-stone word and/or situation for actively reducing your meat intake should be welcomed.

Speaking from personal experience, I was ""flexitarian"" before being vegetarian, and then ultimately becoming vegan. Having a sort of catch-all term that I could use to demonstrate the structure of my diet, and being able to signal to my peers etc. that we should being considering our diets, compared with being a full-on carnist was very useful and became the first part of my journey to moral consistency.

I think less shame should be thrown at people that aren't yet at the same part in their journey as we are and we should find further means to encourage them towards the right direction.

Part of restricting your diet out of ethics is grappling with the fact that your individual choices mean next to nothing and you have next to no reason to feel better than the next person. If veganism pulls you away from society by making you feel like non-vegans are beneath you because they didn't reach enlightenment at the exact time you did, to the point where you are publicly showing disdain for people giving visibility to ethics-based dietary decisions because they are not eating as ""purely"" as you are, you are not doing veganism right.",2022-12-30 01:48:44,5,vegan,theluckkyg,comment,"Can we please stop using the term ""flexitarian""?"

"Honestly, I think it's a good thing. People love labels. They love to be in groups, clans, tribes.

If someone is using flexitarian, then they are likely eating less meat than the average person. Be it for health, moral, or environmental reasons, it is still less meat being consumed. And it is a decision they have given thought to. 

And it also means they are likely having conversations about that decision with omnivore friends and colleagues. Those conversations are where change will happen. Normalizing less meat. Letting omnis convert other omnis to this mindset. Fantastic. I'm all for more people talking about eating less meat. 

And really who cares what they all call themselves? If you get upset over labels, then maybe ask yourself if those labels matter more to you than what you are doing.

"> Excessive meat consumption, like other environmental crises, needs political solutions.

So relieved to see this here. We can't keep [falling for the con](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/jul/17/neoliberalism-has-conned-us-into-fighting-climate-change-as-individuals) that we as individuals can stop climate change. [Emphasizing individual solutions to global problems reduces support for government action](http://news.stanford.edu/2017/06/12/emphasizing-individual-solutions-big-issues-can-reduce-support-government-efforts/), and [what we really need is a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), and [the way we will get it is to lobby for it](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf). 

[People are really resistant to changing their diet](http://tier-im-fokus.ch/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/baroni07.pdf), and even in India, where people don't eat meat for religious reasons, [only about 30% of the population is vegetarian](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2017/06/28/532880755/is-a-no-meat-world-really-better). Even if the rest of the world could come to par with India (a highly unlikely outcome) climate impacts would be reduced by less than 5% (([normINT-vegetBIO)/normINT](http://tier-im-fokus.ch/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/baroni07.pdf)) * [0.3](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2017/06/28/532880755/is-a-no-meat-world-really-better) * [.18](https://www.skepticalscience.com/how-much-meat-contribute-to-gw.html)) And 30% of the world going vegan would reduce global emissions by less than 5.3%. I can have a much larger impact (by roughly an order of magnitude) convincing ~24 *thousand* fellow citizens to [overcome the pluralistic ignorance moneyed interests have instilled in us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) to [lobby Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/) than I could by convincing [the remaining](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2017/06/28/532880755/is-a-no-meat-world-really-better) [251 *million*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States) adults in my home country to go vegan. 

I have no problem with people going vegan, but it really is not an alternative to actually addressing the problem with the [price on carbon that's needed](https://www.nature.com/news/natural-gas-stands-to-get-a-boost-from-carbon-tax-1.17705).

" There are still a lot of people who don't rely on capitalism for subsistence and grow their own food and raise their own pigs or cattle. This concept pretty much turns them into the enemy.

"After reading this and not seeing mention of subsidies in context of political changes, I looked it up and was surprised to see there are no direct subsidies in the US on cattle (aside from lamb, the #1 in co2 emissions).

What I did find, which was interesting was an already established program within the USDA - The Natural Resources Conservation Service. 

This service could easily be leveraged to help farmers institute environmental practices, I.e. what if it could provide a subsidy to farmers to pay for and implement the system to incorporate seaweed into the cattle diet, which has already proven to GREATLY reduce methane emissions. 

People aren’t going to stop eating meat, and industries aren’t going to change overnight, but this feels like a policy we can work on.

"I'll cut my meat and fats consumption when carbs and sugars stop being subsidized and overused by the food industry to feed people. Low-carb is hard enough without demanding I remove even *more* of my available options.

Humans evolved on a diet heavy on proteins, fats, and *very* fibery low-starch plants. 10k years is not even close enough to change up our metabolisms to stop building fat stores so easily on our modern carb-heavy diets, not to mention all the other health problems we develop from so much sugar in our food. 

And the focus on carbs as ""filler"" has led to an over-simplification of our diets. Our produce choices in the typical Western store is laughably small. Go to someplace like an asian market and you have two to three times the selection of leafy greens and herbs available, making it less necessary to fill the diet with starches and other carbs. Not to even mention the tofu selections (which has been bastardized as a vegetarian/vegan specific food in Western diets) or the *mushrooms*. Typical HEB here: Portabella, baby bellas, white, and *maybe* those thin flimsy shitake mushrooms. Whole Foods/Central Market ups the selection to five or six, for a premium price. An asian market - a dozen or more varieties for low price.

We need a serious produce conversion in our grocery stores, but few people speak about *that.* It's all about the evil consequences of meat, not the insidious hidden consequences of a fabricated food pyramid proposed and pushed by a *cereal* company and the results of decades of government subsidies. You notice *other* countries eat lots of meat just fine, but don't have so much carbs in their diet and aren't suffering the obesity rates countries like America is trying to solve?",2019-01-20 05:26:17,-1,environment,TechniChara,comment,"Could flexitarianism save the planet? - Scientists say a drastic cut in meat consumption is needed, but this requires political will"

"Idk I mean I think it’s just a way to identify a person is actively trying to eat less animal products, and those reasons might be more for health or environment than animal welfare.  I think it’s great people will make an effort.  The vast majority of us were raised as omnivores and with society branding it into our brains that every meal should contain animal products, it’s a pretty huge shift to the vegan paradigm.  I think it’s important to meet people where they are at instead of demanding they jump into veganism. It’s a process getting to the point of un-f*cking your mind to realize that animal consumption is inherently cruel and unnecessary- for most people it doesn’t happen overnight.  If flexitarianism allows people to be exposed a bit to a life without animal products a few meals or days at a time, then I think that is helpful overall.   I was “flexitarian” for probably like 6 years before going vegan, the last two I ate about 95% plant based. I held off for so long just out of fear that I would fail, I really believed I lacked the self discipline to commit to veganism for a long time, and I respected veganism enough to know that you’re either vegan or you’re not, there’s no “almost” or “most of the time.”  I think those years of flexitarianism set me up to finally commit to veganism because I knew eating a diet without animal products was doable for me.

I’m a chef in the south. The idea of going vegan is not even on the table for most people. We sling vegan street food in the summer at festivals and people LOVE it. A lot of it is showing people what vegan even means. It gives them a chance to think about it for the first time in their lives. We educate people on it and then they are allowed to make their own decisions.

i also have a friend i grew up as a sister to and her older sister, myself and my older sister all went vegan. she started out “flexitarian”, eating with her older sister, and now is a vegetarian. i think it can help people feel more actively aligned with the movement and encourage them to go further. i think they should be welcomed and supported. no one goes vegan overnight.

Like we have a farmer close to us that uses sheep instead of a lawnmower to keep the grass down on his pretty huge solar field. The sheep there have a really good life and a  beneficial enviromental impact (no lawnmower, convert grass into food, also produce wool and leather and other things).

"When I say ""Is there a vegan option"" or talk about a great vegan restaurant, carnists immediately dismiss me. They already have deep opinions that vegans are annoying or pretentious or difficult -- they sort me into that category. There's not really any chance of connecting with them on this topic in a way that could possibly help move their behavior or lead to less animal harm.

When I say ""we're reducing our meat consumption, is there a veggie/vegan option? NBD if not, I can bring something."" The vast majority of people seem to lean in! They often take on the role of helping me, or at least talk with me about it in an open way. Once it happens a couple times, they usually realize that a certain caterer or restaurant may not be great, and they'll often switch to someplace else.

Absolutely, the best thing is for everyone to be vegan starting yesterday. Based on what I see, carnism is a big ship that will take a long time to turn.

"So you even want an attempt at a personal, animal compassionate, answer for flex? 

I'll try. Not saying I'm representative. But holy hell, Ill try. So I don't classify myself as flexitarian because in my heart all I am gunning for is a vegan way of life (and have gone 3 months and 8 months before..) to work for my constitution— but I eat ""flex"" I guess. 

Even under a vegan naturopath's supervision, due to digestive absorption issues due to a folic acid conversion issue in my DNA and many bean allergies, in the beginning after a certain amount of time with no animal pruducts, I feel a blackness lift from me. 

I become spiritual again, heart opens, I feel cleans and I look beautiful in pictures and once I am not contributing to their suffering, I have a relationship with animals bordering on Animal Communicator. 

Then it tips. 

After about 5 months I become sickly, and my entire mental and physical constitution collapses and i can no longer parent or drive safely, and my muscles waste and I experience extreme depression (or Dark Night). 

My ND said ""I admit for some, the Vegan diet is just too hard on mental health for some bodymind constitutions"". 

Oh the things we have tried. 

So what do I do? 

I buy one steak when we shop. I pray over it. I weep for it. I buy ziplocs (blech) and I break the single serving steak into 20 portions. Like half an ounce each and freeze each. 

And then as I start to fall apart, I defrost throw in one or two bites into the protein per a meal per day. 

All I want is to make my ethics align with my body. I sometimes pray to be reborn as a person like my wife who's now over a decade and a half vegan and animal
rights activist and who's body and mind are in complete harmony with absolute vegan, no exceptions for animal exploration at all and 100% plant based diet. Her Karma is not tinted with death.

She also doesn't know how to cook so I am also her cook, so I cook only vegan for
her and my daughter and flex stop it as minimal as humanly possible. Sometimes I get so bad my wife cries and asks me to eat some meat. 

If I eat meat I want to die out of guilt, and if i don't eat meat I want to die out of chemical deficiencies. 

So while I reluctantly flex, I am also taking yogic and meditation classes to better be able to handle the bodily sensations and overwhelm of pranic energy I experience when animal products are not present. 

My yoga philosophy teacher says that it's not just the lack of animal product I can't handle it's the amount of pranic energy that I haven't learned to take yet and so for me it feels like a anxiety and dread. He says they call it ""Temple food"" for a reason. Monks eat no meat also to speed up mind for meditation. They will only eat it if offered freely and have nothing else.

So we are preparing my nervous system for these levels of awakening and to be able to feel weightless and hungry and thin and empty and cold by embracing it like
those cave yogis do when they are wearing the only a loincloth in the snow in the himalayas . Then again my teacher is a Hindu / Tantrika vegetarian and consumes milk (and maybe eggs? not sure). I could get by on those but won't because I feel that diary industry is even worse than meat if that's even possible. I just can't. 

Oh Samsara. It can never be easy can it? How you never fail to skull fuck all of us beings.",2023-01-27 12:15:00,1,vegan,JustMikeWasTaken,comment,"Flexitarians make my blood boil, what is the point of them?"

"I believe any reduction of animal exploitation is a step in the right direction. I also believe the more often people choose entirely plant based meals, especially when patronizing restaurants, will only expand the available plant based options in the future and would ideally shift the overall trend towards universal plant based options. 

No deeply engrained societal issue resolves itself overnight. You cannot force others to think and act like you do.

"I  know a flexitarian. Person doesn't identify with the label but it is appropriate.

The person is basically a dairy-free vegetarian with multiple allergies that are severe to life-threatening. When faced with the choice of extended hunger/malnutrition or eating eggs or meat, the person will eat eggs or meat. Sometimes that means months without animal products and sometimes that means 1-2x a week depending on where in the world the person is, who is preparing the food, and what safe foods are available.

This person most identifies with the food allergy label, not any of the vegetarian, flexitarian, vegan labels. It makes perfect sense to me.",2023-01-26 14:51:42,1,vegan,ScoutingForAdventure,comment,"Flexitarians make my blood boil, what is the point of them?"

"Personally I dislike the term flexitarian but technically my diet do fall into that category. I'm not vegan but like to be one so I hang around here reading your experiences, learning tips and the vegan lifestyle.

I'm not against eating meat per se but against the cruel practices of the animal farming industry. Since leaning about it I've stop buying leather products and reduce meat intake. I don't purchase meat for myself and if it's served to me at a restaurant or family then I'll have a little.

In an ideal world I would love to be vegan. I want to do better and be that better person. My mental health is rather fragile right now - I'm diagnosed autistic and adhd and depression... my day to day involves constantly fighting the thought of wanting to end things and life is meaningless.

"I don’t title it or anything, but I do fit the definition of what you call a “flexitarian.”

I replace foods that would be from animals with vegan alternatives, including vegan cheeses, almond milk, nutritional yeast, etc. The only meat product I regularly buy is chicken about twice a month and a carton of eggs once a month. I understand your views on this, please don’t spend the extra time calling me cruel or a carnist. I am just sharing an outside perspective.

This is objectively a huge decrease in animal consumption from how I used to live in the past. It’s not perfect, but it’s a *decrease* which is the ultimate goal, right? This also means when vegan friends come over, they have plenty of options to choose from and never feel left out. 

Posts like this make me feel like “well, f it, right? I have no shot at being a “pure” vegan, so why not eat what I want?” 

That mentality is what sets your movement back. I understand the private frustrations from those that have accomplished it already, but some people simply do not have the mental energy yet to allocate to that goal. I say your movement, because despite how some vegans may feel, this is not my fight. I am a bystander just trying to decrease animal consumption. I am not sure if I would ever go “full vegan,” but someone who has learned the food and recipes is more likely to transition than someone who has never done that. 

If everyone at the level of animal consumption I did, by the views of this post, it would be a bad thing. However, overall, it would decrease how many animals die by a huge amount. Isn’t that the ultimate goal for vegans motivated by morality? 

Because otherwise, it feels like some (not OP, just some) are vegans to be pretentious or holier-than-thou. Which is not great for morality based movement.",2023-01-27 04:27:51,0,vegan,Early-Recording-8732,comment,"Flexitarians make my blood boil, what is the point of them?"

"I used to be a flexitarian and not a vegetarian before going vegan. Here are my reasons:

 \- I did not know anything about nutrition and I was afraid to do the full switch (In retrospect, without b12 supplements, I think I was less healthy then than I am now :D );

 \- switching diets should generally be incremental. Going from little fiber to high fiber is a recipe for getting people to hate veganism. Doing it slowly is much better. Here I think it's important to be a flexitarian with the goal to be vegan. The end goal is not to be flexitarian.

"I'm sorry the flexis you've met were like that. That's not my experience at all, and I actually tend to encourage people around me to go flexi, because I look at it as the ""gateway drug"" to veganism, if you know what I mean :)

The core thing is that flexis are not antispecieist, and as much as we may disagree, it's a whole journey to get there... but we all need to start somewhere! I myself started my journey as a weekday vegetarian - so basically a flexitarian. That was an excellent way to learn how to cook without meat. Then I became a weekday vegan, and that made me learn how to cook without cheese and eggs. Finally I was ""mostly vegan"", with the occasional cheesy nibble. That eventually took me to veganism.

"overall, are they reducing animal suffering than they would if they just continued to eat animal products with almost every meal?   
they would probably be reducing overall suffering more than a vegetarian would by abstaining all animal products, except on a sunday roast.

generally, I think people should get off their high horse and appreciate the fact they are making an effort, which is vastly more than most. 

you're also presuming that they are just lying about it. 

the vast majority of vegans haven't even thought about why they're doing it, other than a visceral reaction to the idea of consuming animal products. 

the over arching philosophy is about reducing suffering on sentient creatures. and they're doing that in their own way, hopefully it amounts to more in the future. at least it's a start.

"Almonds, for example, can be grown without any suffering, so they are not intrinsically based on suffering, honey is intrinsically based on suffering as there is currently no way (this is debatable with ""pre-cracked"" hives, but they are extremely uncommon) to farm honey without causing damage to the bees in many forms.   

This means Veganism says ""Honey is bad"", but says "" Almonds can be good."". Now it's up to the Vegan to figure out how to either reduce ""bad"" almonds or replace them.   

Do all Vegans do this? No.   

Does that make them ""Hypocrites""? Yes. 

To be blunt, we're all a little hypocritical in our own ways. Some more than others. Our journey into ""Veganism"" is our effort to try and cut **some** of the hypocrisy out. The reality is no one is ""truly"" vegan as life is suffering. We're all just trying the best we can.

"First thought: Animal are raised on plant crops, and we go through billions of animals per year. Grazing pastures I imagine also have a similarly [devastating effect on habitats](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/02/revealed-amazon-deforestation-driven-global-greed-meat-brazil), and require herd rotations meaning that large plots of land are being left alone to regrow until cows can use it again for grazing. This, as opposed to plant agriculture which I believe uses something like [115 million acres less land](https://faunalytics.org/farming-animals-vs-farming-plants-comparison/) ...

Second thought: Not only vegans eat almond, ollives and rice. In any case, there are far more animals being processed yearly that are sustained entirely on plants crops, that by going vegan, you would be reducing the need for crops anyways.

>Reply:  It's too demanding to avoid almonds, rice, or other crops shown to kill animals, in addition to all the things we already avoid. Veganism is a good-faith effort to reduce  animal suffering as much as possible.  
>  
>Objection: This is precisely the reasoning that vegans reject when given by avegetarian who says it's too hard to stop eating eggs or somebody whoeats meat when they're at a non-vegetarian  restaurant withfriends.Also, if it is the case that some non-animal  product kills moreanimals than an animal product (which seems at least possible foralmonds vs. honey), then veganism fails even at the second goal. If thatwere truly your goal, you would carefully research every food and onlyeat those that kill the fewest animals, not avoid products that comedirectly from animals.

That reasoning is not at all the same. Crops represent very larges sources of cost-efficient nutrition, which cannot be said of meat. We require variety in our diet, whereas we don't require meat. Were you aware that plant agriculture produces almost 2 trillion pounds more product than animal ag, and with **less land?**

>Reply:  These are accidental, incidental deaths, whereas the deaths or  suffering in meat production are intentional and inherent to the  production of animal products.  
>  
>Objection: If you know that these harms are going to happen when you buy rice,I'm  not sure why this makes a moral difference. Your actions are stillleading to the slaughter of sentient beings.

There is a significant ethical difference between an unneccessary action which is sure to create a victim (eating meat) and a nutritionally essential action that may incur some accidental death of wildlife (eating rice aka a food source that feeds literally billions daily). Its the difference between the former requiring a victim, and the latter not requiring one. Its night and day.

Ultimately, humans being on this planet will always cause come accidental harm...but we can make choices that avoid purposefully doing so.

Final thoughts: There will always be suffering in wildlife, whats best is to look after ourselves and only do what is neccessary to live. What is not necessary in this day and age is horrific mass reproduction of sentient beings so ppl can eat steaks and burgers while ethical options exist. You're deluding yourself if you think the suffering caused by crop growth isnt also equally caused by production of animal pastures. At least were operating with a smaller ecological footprint when talking about plant crops. Its like your ignoring the fact that climate change is occurring and that its being tugged along at a rapid pace by animal ag.",2021-07-02 17:24:12,8,DebateAVegan,lilac-forest,comment,Are vegans hypocritical in criticizing vegetarians/flexitarians?

"The article on bees in regards to almonds is really interesting, I have somehow never heard about this awful practice and it's really not a big deal for me to drop almonds entirely personally because I've never liked the milk and rarely ate them as a snack due to being allergic to most nuts (I'm not allergic to them but it just kinda wigs me out cuz they're close to something that can kill me).

I would say that the difference between them and what vegetarians eat (eggs, dairy) is that we can imagine improvements on how almonds are harvested, possibly even on the level of production they are now or at least a decent percentage, without this exploitation whereas it would be nearly impossible with dairy and eggs. 

I'm unsure of the logistics about why 80% of all the world's almonds are grown in California but it seems like being able to diversify location would help based on what the article suggests are the contributing factors to the bee deaths. 

The other two articles I would say sound like they are logistically even easier to solve and aren't as integrated into how the crops are produced. 

Olives again are something that I think almost any vegan could drop from their diet if necessary. It sounds like from the article the farmers might be actively ignoring the issue and actually profiting from their cull by selling the dead birds. It sounds like there should be a solution to this but people actively don't care about the welfare of the animals. 

So olives are probably worth dropping for sure although again contrasting with a vegetarian diet, the thing that is openly mocked of ""free range cattle"" that is still active exploitation would actually apply to olives. Where if you know that they are farmed without harming birds there isn't any issue purchasing them. 

Finally, the rice article with ducks is almost definitely an issue with regulation and the article even has in it that the hunting is leveraging the protection of the crops as an excuse. Some of the ducks don't threaten the rice and there are almost certainly better ways of protecting the crops. Plus this is in reference to one particular area of rice farming, one of the most diverse and most planted crops in the world (the most planted?) The article even references at the end 

>‘‘When you are in Bali, there are ducks all over the rice and they don’t shoot them,’’

So it's an issue with a particular area, not the crop itself inherently causing production issues. 


So in conclusion:

Almonds sound like the process in which they are produced are most intertwined with the deaths they cause but simultaneously it sounds like there is much more effort going into fixing this problem. People don't want bees to die in this process, it's actually bad for business in this instance. That being said, it sounds like almonds are pretty sketch and should be avoided until they figure out these issues. 

Olives sounds like people are actively benefitting from killing the birds while harvesting so it may be difficult to enact protection but it should be very possible. People should definitely investigate where they get their olives from and try to force regulations.

Rice is much too large of a crop for your example, and the example is almost unrelated to how it is being farmed. It would be silly to avoid rice just because of this.

Lastly, all of these can apply to any vegetarian dish because they exploit animals directly and also much of their feed will have similar issues! So it's two-fold.",2021-07-02 17:21:28,2,DebateAVegan,aceguy123,comment,Are vegans hypocritical in criticizing vegetarians/flexitarians?
"First, remember that these issues you're addressing are not solely due to vegans. Like...the consumption of olives is massive amongst omnivores. Spain are obsessed with olives and eat huge amounts, and the Italians love their olive oil. Meanwhile I'm a vegan and I've never even ate an olive. So these products are not solely an issue caused by vegans.

As for the almonds. Bees wouldn't be exploited in this way if there was no demand for honey. Honey bees are not good pollinators, and they chase and kill off native bees. If we weren't demanding honey, honey bees wouldn't be used, and native bees would be able to thrive and work symbiotically with humans 

>Objection: This is precisely the reasoning that vegans reject when given by a vegetarian who says it's too hard to stop eating eggs or somebody who eats meat when they're at a non-vegetarian restaurant with friends.

Being vegan is the BARE MINUMUM people can do. Cutting out almonds, palm oil, etc are bonuses and help more, just like...getting a bus would be better than a car. But vegansim is still the bare minimum people should be doing.


> If you know that these harms are going to happen when you buy rice, I'm not sure why this makes a moral difference. Your actions are still leading to the slaughter of sentient beings.

We have to eat something. Rice is one of the cheapest foods available and many of us our poor. It's incredibly privileged to imply vegans shouldn't be eating rice, meanwhile the rest of the population eats rice, almonds, honey, AND animals.

We need food to survive, and rice is less harmful than meat. It's about picking the better choice and reducing harm as much as possible, not about 0 death perfection.

The bare minimum of vegansims is cutting out animal products. If we have the money and accessibility to cut out rice and almonds then that's great, its another bonus!

2) Virtually all food production involves some sort of incidental death SOMEWHERE on the supply chain so these are not unique cases

3) Eating animal products on average will result in more death and suffering largely because of the trophic pyramid and the fact that we feed animals crops, thus when you eat meat you are supporting the death of the animals themselves as well as the deaths of the animals used to grow the crops

Clearly I think veganism is morally better than vegetarianism, but I don't think it's the best any of us can do, not by a long shot.

One thought though; my reasoning for drawing my line here, is that meat cannot be produced without killing an animal (yet). Almonds hypothetically could.

There is often a before and after conversion experience etc.  This feeling of moral superiority is dependent on adherence to the strict moral code and thus people who don't quite comply aren't quite moral,  which is threatening identity-wise,  unlike those who don't try at all (eg non veg folks) hence the intolerance towards flexitarians as well as to the non veg.   My guess is that this sort of intolerance would be less present in people who came to be vegetarian for practical (eg health) reasons vs moral ones.

"Flexitarian is a dumb name, but the concept is sound. I prefer ""meat avoider"". I could call myself a lactovegetarian with loopholes or a pescatarian, but meat avoider is more precise. I avoid meat 95% of the time, but it somebody serves it to me I will probably eat it, or if I feel particularly low on iron once or twice a month I will have some tuna. Eating meat 5% of the time isn't enough to call me an omnivore. It's not precise enough. Not that I label myself or go on about my dietary choices unless people ask (or on a forum like this where that's the point). Usually I identify myself to people, when they ask, as ""a vegetarian most of the time"". That lets them know I might make an exception for them, but not to assume that I'm fine with eating meat every day because I'm not. ",2013-07-15 08:03:54,3,vegetarian,ohtheheavywater,comment,Why do so many veg*ns shame 'flexitarians'?

"I was vegetarian before vegan, but it had *nothing* to do with the animals. My motivations were 100% selfish. I couldn't care less about the animals. Vegans were insane. Leather was fine. Hunting/fishing was fine. Zoos were wonderful. Through my life: I was on the standard American diet, then was vegetarian, then ovo-pescatarian, then standard American diet, then vegetarian, then I made the leap. 

But the big thing is: There were no baby steps when I made the leap to vegan. I cheated a lot as a vegetarian. I went back and forth out of vegetarianism. If I ordered a vegetarian burrito and they gave me chicken, I would shrug it off. The moment I saw Gary Yourofsky's speech (followed up by watching Dominion), I threw out any food that still involved animal exploitation. I ordered a hemp wallet, I stopped buying shoes and belts without cowskin (which I still hate doing), and I never once considered any other option.

Would it be hypocritical for me to roll my eyes at someone else's baby steps? I don't think so. The moment my eyes were opened and I made the ethical connection, I was all-in.

"I'm sorry but as a vegan for 3.5 years who did it through ""baby steps"", this whole post is ridiculous and does nothing for our cause. Anytime a person makes an active choice to reduce their meat and dairy consumption, they are helping reduce the effects on the environment and lowering the demand for meat and dairy. The reason that meat and dairy has such a terrible impact on the environment is because we cannot sustain the current level at which people are consuming meat and dairy. Anytime we shoot down peoples efforts and tell them it's not good enough we drive them further away from the cause. 

It is incredibly naive and unrealistic to expect the world to turn into a vegan utopia. People are going to still eat meat, whether you like it or not. I don't like it, but I accept it. That's a reality you have to accept and if you can't, you're exactly the kind of vegan people like to make examples out of. We can hope to make the need for&sourcing of meat and dairy as minuscule and as ""ethical"" as possible.

I know I'm going to get downvotes for this and get told I'm not a ""real vegan"" but my dedication to this cause is strong enough that I can actually get a grip on reality that we can't change everybody's mind, but we can try to do what's best for the WHOLE planet and the animals.

"Interesting read.  Without having read the resources in the author's bibliography, I have a few thoughts:

* Numbers: where are they?  I'm all for a vegan-or-nothing approach if it works, but where's the quantitative evidence that it does?  And if it does, how large are the studies, have they been backed up by other studies, do they hold across lots of different subpopulations, etc.?
* This isn't the hugest thing, but:  Comparing smoking cessation strategies to strategies toward going vegan isn't necessarily valid.  There might be some commonalities between the two and it would be worth exploring what works in one and seeing if it works in the other.  But animal products are SO much more institutionalized on omnipresent in our society than smoking is, at this point.  Consuming animal products is something everyone does multiple times per day every day for their entire lives (unless they go vegan, of course, and even we aren't perfect).  Comparatively few people smoke, and laws and social norms continue to shift against smoking.  I need quantitative evidence that the cold-turkey approach to veganism works on a wide scale, not speculation based on the effectiveness of different smoking cessation strategies.  (Also, quitting smoking has a whole biological/medical component that going vegan doesn't, and differences in strategy effectiveness might emerge because of that.)
* Not that we shouldn't be critical of nonprofit organizations just because they're doing good work - actually I think the comments about the conflict of interest they have quite insightful - but the fact of the matter is they DO do good work.  Their work, while often promoting flexitarianism/small changes, DOES save a lot of lives.  I think it's intellectually dishonest to bash them without acknowledging the good they do, and without comparing the good they do to the good more radical animal rights organizations do in terms of numbers.  (Now, of course, a good study will find a way to account for resource disparity, because of course the bigger organizations are going to do more good than smaller ones just because they have more resources to do good with.)  
* On pgs. 13 and 14, the author complains (for want of a better term) about people identifying with a movement without actually engaging in activism for it (e.g. identifying as feminist without engaging in feminist agitation).  First, I think it's important to note that other than being vegan ourselves, I highly doubt most of us do any significant animal activist work or make significant charitable donations to animal rights organizations.  Yet we still call ourselves ""vegans.""  Do you have to be an activist to be vegan?  Obviously it's good to be an activist, but I don't think being an activist is necessary to being a vegan, especially if you want to conceptualize veganism as an ""identity"" or a ""philosophy.""  Second, the author conjectures that identifying with a movement without actually doing any work to help the cause can undermine a movement's ability to do good.  I can't access the whole Tufecki resource she cites on this, but I did actually skim through the McAdam 1986 resource, and I find the use of it in support of her point, again, kind of intellectually dishonest.  On its face what she says is correct:  networks help get people into activism.  But McAdam doesn't criticize low-engagement activism.  Actually, he conjectures that ""low-risk activism""/""low-risk"" participation in a social movement can lead people to engage in more and higher-risk activism down the line.  So... baby steps do work, then?  And ""free-riding"" isn't detrimental to a movement?  Also, I think it's worth noting that based on his, he concludes that attitudes/beliefs don't ultimately differentiate activists from non-activists, and beliefs in themselves don't make an activist: social connections do.  Perhaps this is why animal rights organizations don't focus on the moral arguments as much.  (Also, ALL of this said, this is an article on what is essentially a case study of a non-animal rights event from thirty years ago... not exactly great empirical evidence.)

"An alcoholic, such as I am, did not stop drinking by doing baby steps.  That stuff was killing me.  I stopped drinking on the 27th January 2015 and not touched a drop since.

I went vegan on the 1st October 2018 and not touched meat or knowingly bought animal products since.  I have been eliminating animal product through clothing, which is taking longer, but I'm not replacing it with non-vegan clothing.

Instead of the gradual process what I did was this:  I set a specific date, planned changes to my food cupboard and then switched.  I probably had around a couple of weeks where I was using up my non-vegan foods in preparation.

That worked for me, because I took the time and effort to reinforce my commitment to that date leading up to it, and after that date my food cupboard and my mind was ready to switch.  The personal health benefits were a major plus, but not the reason why I had initially decided to go vegan in the first place (thank you, Earthlings).",2020-02-17 11:17:02,6,vegan,,comment,"Baby steps are often ineffective at creating a lasting change.

"I disagree. Studies on populations show averages; there are always the folks who make a lasting commitment to change after a series of ""baby steps,"" and (even more common and probably not even an outlier) people whose overnight attempt to change flames out in failure.

Anecdata, but my personal experience attests to this. My first attempt at veganism was in 1995. With no Internet, no vegan friends, and nothing helpful in the library, I had no idea what I was doing. (I remember one ""lunch"" was sunflower seeds and apple juice.) I felt like garbage and quit after like two days. The second attempt was a series of baby steps during the first half of 1996 (Jan/Feb to June). I had the same barriers as before, but this time slowly cut things out one food type at a time. (The last to go were baked goods, because I didn't know how to bake vegan.) That attempt has lasted for nearly 25 years now.

People these days probably have fewer obstacles than I did, at least when it comes to information (my family were begrudgingly supportive, and my friends didn't give me guff). But I'd rather give them the benefit of the doubt.

Or then the ""but it is so hard argument"": I think it is childish and like you don't have control over your own actions/decisions.

I hear stuff like: It is so easy for you but I am in a different situation. When I was in one of the ""hardest"" places to start when going vegan myself like 10 years ago. I was about15-16 lived with my father, had to learn to cook mostly for myself, go shopping once a week tops to a cheap supermarket with no special vegan options (no soymilk, no tofu) on a budget and there was no other vegan in my village or school I knew about. I did not know about online communities. I was made fun of by my family, friends and in school for being vegan. It was not hard to be vegan. Because there are so many good reasons. To think a small problem with in your social interaction or to have to learn to cook some new things is more important than the entire life and death of a sentient being is just laughable.

On the other hand, I feel that frustration towards vegetarians/pescetarians too sometimes, like they want to both have the cake and eat it. Either you're contributing to animal cruelty or you're not. 

But I was vegetarian for four years before recently going vegan, and as someone with restrictive eating disorder tendencies, that time was necessary.

"If they really need a transition, people can do it slowly in less than a month. You could identify yourself as someone transitioning to veganism. When I see vegetarians, they already created an identity, they can get stuck there and do it for years before waking up to the unnecessary suffering they still cause. I welcome people really trying to be vegan because it is the necessary thing to do if we want ethics to mean less suffering - as any other possible criteria for ethics is inconsistent or creates arbitrary lines that are not justifiable. Now when someone thinks it is more ethical to be vegetarian than a regular omni, surely it is - but it's still unethical. If a vegetarian is doing it for ethical reasons, I'd question what they think ethics is. We can encourage people to take a bit of time to understand veganism and change their lifes, but I don't recommend encouraging vegetarianism.  


I can't see how people slip up on being vegan just for the urge to eat an animal product. People wouldn't normally slip up to an unethical behavior just because they'd get some peasure from it.

"I think it's because of the amount of vegetarians who are virtue signalers who claim to be making a difference for animals and care about them, but their actions suggest otherwise. Dairy and egg are extensions of the meat industry after all. Their excuses for not giving up dairy and eggs are also weak and debunked. When I first was interested in going vegetarian over vegan because it was ""easier"" but still felt like an ethically superior decision, I was glad when someone called out my hypocrisy.

Another reason, is we don't want the message or definition of veganism being muddied and vague through accepting omnivore excuses. Why would I tell a guy who beats his wife to simply ""reduce"" the amount he beats his wife? Fuck that, I'm telling him to stop beating her, period. Veganism seeks to reduce harm as far as practically possible, and for the vast majority of people who have access to grocery stores and limited allergies/health conditions, eliminating animal products completely is ENTIRELY possible.

Like really? You don't have enough confidence in yourself, in the strength of your resolve, to commit to abstaining from a few foods? It's OKAY to fail if you give a genuine effort. It is not okay to put in minimal effort or not try at all.

"I think it's a balance of knowledge vs. actions. I don't even blame omnivores who have been socialized into their animal consumption habits, by default. The time where irritation or blame sets in is when they are presented with or are otherwise aware of their actions but try to argue that they are ethical.

Example: let's say a vegetarian says they they eat cheese and eggs because it's not killing any animals. I don't really mind that. Their heart is in the right place, they're just not aware that buying dairy nearly always requires killing the males early and killing females when they stop producing. Once they do know this, then I might get a little judgmental, though it might take some time for them to process everything.

I don't really mind vegetarians looking for solidarity, what some people here see as giving themselves a pat on the back. They're correct that they've reduced harm and in their understanding, eliminated it in this part of their lives. They're should be feeling good about it.

I think people need to be treated kindly, because, per aesop's fable, the wind can try to pull off someone's coat, but the sun will inspire them to take it off themself.

I see funding and endorsing mass death as the latter. So no, reductionism is not okay and I'm not going to pretend it is. 

If someone tells me they have been reducing or done veganuary or something, I won't praise them like a toddler. But I will take it as an opportunity to do some light education.

We shouldn't praise people for meatless Mondays if they're not open to hearing and thinking about the vegan message. That's just vegan tourism. 

I know plenty of people who have taken steps towards veganism and know it's the right thing to do but they don't feel they can commit 100% just yet. I know a lot of vegans are frustrated by that but that's human psychology - people don't always stop smoking, go on a diet or become vegan immediately even if they want to do it. That's just how humans are. 

I'll even give you an example: I work with a guy I've introduced to veganism as an ethical philosophy. He now believes it's the right thing to do, but he's not quite ready to go full vegan yet. He's basically vegetarian so far. I'm supportive and encouraging. I think if I can get him to watch Dominion or similar it'll push him over the line. I'll keep working on it. 

Final point for now: I wish people would stop comparing reducing animal products to people doing less murdering, raping, etc. Those things are considered immoral by society.

"What should be praised is the decision to eat less meat - both because it is a good decision, and because praising it may encourage the person to eat even less meat.

Unfortunately no one can become totally uninvolved in animal cruelty. If I buy an apple for a dollar and the apple seller uses the dollar to buy meat, I have become involved - indirectly, and to a very small degree. \[Edit: Fiksdal correctly points out below that I am not in control of this person's decisions, which makes this an imperfect example. I should have said: by participating in the normal economy, I am knowingly, indirectly, funding animal cruelty. Another example: I pay taxes in the U.S. that fund dairy subsidies.\]

I think veganism is the decision to significantly reduce the degree of one's involvement. 'Reduction' is a good destination, and a stopping place on the road toward greater and more demanding moral decisions. The same is true of veganism, which should be seen not as a final destination, but only one step that one ought to take, if possible, to reduce one's complicity in evil.

Moral purity is not attainable. But can vegans take pride in being closer to this condition than reductarians are? It depends on how we measure. I think of both groups as climbing the same staircase.

"It might be helpful to put yourself in the place of someone doing something wrong, so you can better understand why mere reduction of harm might be considered praiseworthy.

In the medium-term future (say a few hundred years from now), imagine that **we meet aliens** from some far off world with a culture unlike anything earthlings have ever considered before. They are properly weird, to the point where it takes a massive effort just to communicate with them and understand their points of view on many different things.

One such thing that is legit weird is their sense of ethics. They have no issues with certain things that we think are horrific; and they have strong moral disgust toward some things that we think are quite fine. In order for us to cooperate in a larger community with these aliens, we decide to merge our ethics so that they stop doing the things that we object to, and we stop doing the things that they object to.

These new morals get passed on to new generations who eventually treat them as their own, since they no longer consider society to be ""human society"", but the combined ""human+alien"" society. Only a few hundred years ago, people would proudly claim to be a Maryland citizen first, before being a US citizen — in the same way, these future children of our will not consider themselves humans first, and so they will not think of *their* ethics as being solely the ethics that derived from old human culture.

Now we have a situation where **our future descendants might legitimately feel that something you are doing right now is deeply morally wrong**. For the sake of example, let's call this deeply immoral thing ""standing up"".

Every time you have ever stood up, you have done something as morally evil as murdering another being. If you ever stand up in the future, you will be doing something so vile and heinous that these future children of ours will gasp at your shocking disregard for what is so obviously and disgustingly wrong.

Knowing this to be the case, to what extent will you stop standing up in the future?

Some people, armed with this knowledge of the ""true"" ethics, may indeed never stand up again. This is certainly possible. Wheelchairs exist. Much of our world is accessible to those who don't stand. But I imagine that most people reading this will only *reduce* how often they stand. Some of us may reduce it a lot. Some may reduce it just a little. A few heartless people may completely disregard this new ethics, and some may even stand *more* often, but many of us will just try not to stand unnecessarily. Sure, if we have to change a light bulb. Or maybe if we live in a house with stairs, or if we need to get that plate from the high cabinet. It's just a quick stand to get those things. We still care about not standing up generally; it's just that we really need to get that bag of sugar.

Now be honest with yourself: if not standing was legitimately bad, *for real*, wouldn't we still want to praise those of us that decided to *mostly* not stand? If a person stood occasionally, wouldn't we still praise them for having reduced so much of their standing?

I think that we would. Maybe you personally would never stand again. If so, I applaud you. That is legitimately difficult to do. But not all of us can make such a change, especially if we still think of the ""real"" ethics being the human-based ethics where standing is not really immoral. I imagine many people who stand occasionally will have, in the back of their mind, an unconscious bias where even though they intellectually know that both murder and standing up are equally bad, they don't treat standing up as nearly so bad, and so occasionally break the rules. But they don't mean anything by it; they really are trying hard.

I think that we should take them at their word. They really *are* trying hard. And so, too, are some not-quite-vegans. For you, being vegan took X amount of effort — maybe it was easy, maybe it took a little concentration — but for some people, it takes an order of magnitude more effort. For them, the same level of effort you used to be more moral got them merely to vegetarianism. For some of these people, they *really are* trying hard. I think we should give them some credit for this.

If this thought experiment is too weird for you, know that **this isn't fictional. Something like this is happening right now in today's society.** Have you ever bought a t-shirt? Then you are complicit in promoting slavery. Have you ever used a mobile phone? Did you know that you support oligarchs every time you go to work instead of demonstrating in the streets? Have you ever witnessed someone hit their child, or leave a dog in a car parking lot, or seen your mother do the dishes while the superbowl is on? Did you stand up to say anything about it?

And yet, if we try to not buy the worst t-shirts, if we try to make up for our mobile phone use, if we only spend some of our life working and still take the time to march in the streets occasionally — if we do these things, isn't that morally praiseworthy? **If so, then we should also praise those who eat less meat, even if they haven't gone fully vegan yet.**",2022-03-11 13:39:59,2,vegan,EricHerboso,comment,"Should we praise people for ""reducing"" their animal product consumption?"

Especially if there are waste free alternatives readily available (meaning the vegan substitutes readily available today).,2022-03-11 20:47:12,2,vegan,QuenchiestJerkbender,comment,"Should we praise people for ""reducing"" their animal product consumption?"
"I desperately want the baseline to be vegan but unfortunately it’s not. The way to get there is not linear or a one time, one way binary switch for each human. There’s nothing to be gained from shaming someone for not doing the right thing all the time when they are doing it sometimes. And the hard truth is that, we can all do better.

I don’t think we should necessarily praise them but I do think we should support them in taking a step forward and encourage them to go the rest of the way. If someone reduces their animal consumption it means they’re are thinking about the ethical implications and have some sort of conviction. Praising them may imply that reduction is sufficient when it is not but approaching them with criticism and negative may discourage them also. I think a “good for you for taking this step.

My view is unless you're living completely self sustainably someone or something is suffering to bring a curated product to you.

"The consequence of this though, is that when you say you're a vegetarian and then knowingly eat fish, it sets a precedent to the people that you are with that vegetarians eat fish and when I come to their house, they can feed me fish. 

Also, it's not like ""you ate a fish once, you're banished to pescatarianism forever"" it's about the foods you choose to include in your current/future diet. Most vegans have eaten bacon at some point in their life, that doesn't make them not vegan though, since they now make the choice to change their diet. Labelling your diet doesn't exist to make you feel bad about yourself or your choices, but is super-helpful in letting me know what to cook if I invite you over for dinner, or am sending you a birthday cake. 

Also, for most people, this is a moral/ethical choice. There is nothing inherently unhealthy about including meat in your diet in moderation. And while both of those pictures you posted annoy me, because they don't foster discussion and just turn into a huge circlejerk of ""omg animals have souls too"" they are really different images. The first is factual. Cows, like most mammals, have attachments to their offspring and are going to be distressed when you forcibly separate them. 

That painting is straight up creepy.

I don't find the vegetarian community to be particularly judgmental, but they also don't hold back on their personal motivation for choosing this lifestyle. 
Yeah, learning about where your food comes from is shocking and scary and overwhelming and makes you feel like nothing is ""safe"" to eat, but at the end of the day it's still where your food comes from. When someone says, I'm interested in becoming a vegetarian in this subreddit, they always receive a ton of comments filled with suggestions on recipes, documentaries and books, as well as a ton of support on how to tell their family, tips on eating out, and tips on eating with others.

"Here's the thing with labels: they have a practical purpose, but only when their meaning is actually understood by most people.  When I say I'm a vegetarian, I mean the *actual* meaning of vegetarian, which is that I don't eat anything produced using the byproducts of animal slaughter.

When I'm at a catered work lunch and I and my two vegetarian coworkers ask for vegetarian lunch options, and the three of us get tuna salad sandwiches, I'm going to be pissed off about the ""labeling"" issue.  Because this misunderstanding happened only because the person ordering the food somehow got the mistaken impression that vegetarians eat fish.  *They don't*.  If you eat fish, you are not a vegetarian, you are a person whose diet does not include meat or poultry but does include fish.  That doesn't mean you're a ""vegetarian who eats fish,"" because that would be saying you're ""a person who doesn't eat fish who eats fish.""  That's not any sort of vegetarian.  Pescetarian is a good word, though!  It gets the point across quite clearly!

Similarly, if you're somebody who does not eat meat except on Thursdays, you're not a vegetarian.  You're an omnivore who eats vegetarian meals every day except Thursday.  And that's *great* because more people should endeavor to eat less meat regardless of whether they commit to begin a vegetarian.  The whole ""Meatless Mondays"" campaign is a great idea!  But somebody who participates thusly still isn't a *vegetarian*.

Why does it matter?  Because words mean things.  Words are only useful if they mean things, and if the speaker and listener are mutually clear on what the thing is that the word means.

As for things like leather...  I have several leather products that I continue to use (since they're durable and will be useful for years to come), but I do not purchase leather goods.  This is not because vegetarians do not wear leather.  Rather, I am a person who does not purchase leather goods *for the same reason* that I'm a vegetarian.  And since many or most vegetarians are moral vegetarians, many or most vegetarians are going to avoid leather for the same reason.  Doesn't mean they're one and the same thing, but there's going to be overlap of concerns, in the same way that /r/science and /r/skeptic have overlap, and /r/lgbt and /r/atheism have overlap.  And oh, does that piss some people off...  But that's the community you're a part of.  Most of the people in this subreddit are vegetarians for moral reasons.  Does that mean you're *wrong* for being a vegetarian for other reasons?  No.  But it does mean you're just going to have to deal with us talking about things like non-leather shoes.

"I guess that it depends on how much power you put into a label. I do get annoyed when someone who calls themselves a vegetarian eats fish or something. Not because it's threatening my ""label"" or anything, but simply because that's not what that word means. ""Vegetarian"" has a definition. But if you want to not use labels at all then there are no rules that you have to abide by, so it's silly for someone to call you out on anything like that.

"> As a community, we should emphasize that vegetarian living is a lifestyle and an approach to diet and doesn't always need to carry the added burden of morality and politics

Isn't that called dietary vegetarianism? I agree labels are very misleading, but since words are just carriers of information, adding a one-word prefix (ethical/dietary/health/environment) and recognize different reasons behind vegetarianism seems to me like a better approach than telling a virtual community what to think.

I don't know, I like being specific and call things accurate, but it doesn't mean I **judge** people for different opinions. When I see someone calling himself/herself a vegetarian while he/she is eating a chicken, it's not about the label or the fact of eating meat, but about the misleading of others. There are tons of coined terms like pollotarianism or flexitarianism which fits, why use the wrong word? To feel better about yourself? To be part of a certain community?

"What you call ""ultra-specific"" labeling is simply using language, the way humans do. We have specific words for things. We don't call a table a chair, or a spoon a fork. It has nothing to do with exclusion, if I call you a lacto-ovo vegetarian instead of a vegan because you eat milk and eggs, it doesn't mean that I won't be friends with you or share a meal with you. If somebody goes from eating meat 7 times a week to 2 times a week, I won't call them a vegetarian but I will applaud the change. 

The closer people get to an object, the more specific their terminology becomes.  I for example have a very limited botanical vocabulary - essentially limited to words like ""tree"", ""bush"", ""flower"". If I were to start taking an interest in flowers, I would start using specific words to describe all the different types. It seems that you may until recently have had very little connection with the concept of eliminating meat from diet, and so it was one general concept. Once you actually became interested in the matter, you discovered all the different habits and associated terms. There's really no reason to be taken aback by that and I think you are giving it more meaning than it has. 

As for the presence of ethical themes here, well that's what it's all about for many people. Asking them to not post anything related to animals or ethics is frankly nonsensical, when that's the whole point of vegetarianism for many people. You can't expect people to completely change their priorities and posting habits to suit your narrow comfort zone. If you are only interested in food recipes, there are several subreddits just for recipes.

"this is a great discussion you started! i agree with your sentiment, mostly. 

vegetarian or vegan are labels that state our intentions and beliefs, as with any other label. we may not be perfect, but the label is our ideal and what we're striving towards. for example, a catholic who has pre-marital sex can still identify as catholic, even if pre-marital sex is prohibited by the church. so a vegan who occasionally slips by having a slice of cheese pizza is still a vegan in my eyes if their day to day goal is to consume no animal products. did they make a mistake on that one day per their label? yes. are humans allowed to make mistakes? of course. some people are in situations where it's easier not to cheat, and some people have admirable willpower to stand up for what they believe in 100% of the time instead of 99% of the time. i don't think it's fair to make a 99% vegetarian call themselves omnivore if that person tries to not make that mistake again. it gets murky when someone eats vegetarian 90% of the time or 75% of the time, because at that point animal products are a regular part of your diet, which is definitely not vegetarian.

i think the difference in labels is intention. to use an example in a different post, if a person eats vegetarian every day except on thursdays, on which day they consciously and regularly plan to eat meat, i don't think that person is vegetarian. since their PLANNED diet includes both animal foods and plant foods, they are an omnivore, even if the 90% of what they eat are plant foods. (and that's a great step! that'd be great if more omnivores ate that kind of plant to animal ratio.)

ultimately, i believe it's ok to call yourself vegetarian or vegan even if you mess up once in a while, as long as you strive to avoid animal products 100% of the time.",2012-07-25 21:36:17,4,vegetarian,,comment,The labelling and judgement of vegatarians/vegans/flexitarians/etc. are alienating and detrimental to the lifestyle.

I rarely eat dairy products and even then I would rather only do that if I know calves where not slaughtered in the process of producing it.

"Well, if the general response to this post is truly indicative of this subreddit's sentiments about this issue...then, OP, I think we might just belong in a different subreddit. I wholeheartedly agree with your post, and I would much rather have a community with a ""big tent"" philosophy toward vegetarianism that includes the whole spectrum--from people just trying to significantly reduce meat in their diet to hardcore vegans--but it doesn't look like this subreddit fits that bill.

I should add that I'm totally ok with this subreddit wanting to be about ethical vegetarianism, but that, as the OP mentioned, that IS alienating to those of us just trying to eat a plant-based diet for health reasons.

"It is a moral issue and the majority of people who live anywhere in the first world are on the wrong side of it. Whether or not they are willing to acknowledge this, most of them know it and since most people don't enjoy being on the wrong side of a moral issue they employ an amazing host of tools (confirmation bias & cognitive dissonance) to cope.

I believe that what the OP is really talking about is how to balance the conversation when talking to humans (who are by and large more emotional/irrational than they are rational- even more so when it comes to something like their daily dietary choices) about something that they know they do wrong but aren't prepared to change.

I agree that there are more effective ways to engage people on this issue than constantly shoving the moral aspects of this issue in their faces. However, the answer isn't to never discuss or bring up the moral & ethical consequences of a persons dietary choices. It seems to me that this is what the OP is advocating for. I believe that this is the wrong answer. Yes, those of us interested in promoting the not eating of other sentient beings need to be looking for effective methods... however, sometimes, whether ""effective"" or not, the moral/ethical implications of animal agriculture need to be brought up.

One of the great thing about being a vegetarian for non-ethical reasons is that you can immediately shut down a lot of these conversations if someone tries to get in your face about it.

Also, humorously a lot of the anti-vegetarian people I come across seem to be okay with it as long as you pretend you don't give a shit about animals, even though you are a vegetarian.

I personally consider my self a vegetarian and have for the past 4 years, but rarely I will eat fish. To compare its almost like calling yourself a world traveler because you went on the high school trip to Germany. The frequency just isn't there. For me to proclaim myself a pescatarian would then mean I would be bombarded with fish dishes and widely understood that they should feed me fish. In reality I feel like an ovo-lacto vegetarian who dabbles in fish.  Which really doesn't mean much to anyone aside from other vegetarians.

So I'm not vegetarian because I use chicken broth in cooking? I know it's made by meat but I always thought ""not eating meat"" meant not eating a big slab of whatever (rather than a product that's made by it). Same thing goes for gelatin and all that.

"I disagree to an extent. 

I think you need to know a few important things before going full vegan. Some hurdles where a transition might be helpful during a transition:

- People without any knowledge on nutrition. Immediate switch can impact their health and make them rebound. E.g. incomplete proteins, B12, Iodine, omegas (DHA particularly). Also tricky if you're an intense athlete used to rice and chicken with say nut allergy, wheat intolerance, fiber intake restrictions (e.g. partial removal of bowel), etc.

 - No income and not in control of your food. Will take time to try and convince your food supplier (e.g. parents) to switch to vegan.

- Not knowing the full picture. Takes time to research the motives behind vegan and to see enough evidence to motivate making the switch. At first I thought pescatarian was enough, then vegetarian.

- People who don't know how to cook. This one is more just to make vegan food taste edible (imagine knowing nothing then making tofu for the first time). Even though I know vegan food is amazing, I thankfully know how to cook tasty healthy food.

- Not knowing where to get ingredients or what suits your taste. Tofu varieties, buckwheat, vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, sietan, healthy or tasty meat subs, which plant milks to use and where.

- Not knowing some things aren't vegan which you might not think to check (I'm still learning this one), e.g. sugar, beer, wine, beauty products, sauces, etc.

- Picky eaters. Some people have real sensory problems (for various reasons from experiences to autism spectrum disorder) and it takes a while to find out what you can replace your existing diet with.",2022-04-05 21:44:25,38,vegan,VeggieMan97,comment,You don’t need baby steps

Actually, there IS a need for this.

If you try something new and are told it's not good enough, the chances of you trying it again will often go way down. Some people will even do a full 180 and go extreme with whatever they were doing in the first place. (E.g. ""That's not vegan enough"" ""Well fuck it then I'm going full carnivore!!!"") Last thing we want to do is scare away folks that are considering more vegan options.

For those who went ""cold tofu"" (hehe) that's awesome, I'm happy for you! But just because it was easy for you doesn't mean it's easy for everyone else.

Also, I don't know a single vegan in real life who didn't struggle with the transition to some extent. So, while this may be YOUR experience, I don't think your viewpoint is entirely honest.

Expecting most people to go vegan cold-turkey is unrealistic. Lots of people can't make such significant lifestyle changes overnight, for various reasons. I couldn't. The gradual process was how I convinced myself that I could make the switch.

I totally get the frustration with vegetarianism. I argue against this ""compromise"" with my friends any chance I get. That said, if someone is taking baby steps, and they really do want and plan to go vegan, just let them go at their own pace. Even if they don't, the process of improving themselves will make them more open to listening to vegan advocates!",2022-04-06 01:04:12,2,vegan,quirkscrew,comment,You don’t need baby steps
"Folks often ask if it was hard or if I crave things I used to eat. It wasn’t hard and I don’t crave. 

Sure I wish I could easily grab a slice of pizza when I’m on vacation from a local vendor, I don’t miss the inherent dissonance of eating something produced through suffering and pain.

"Kudos posting something that seems controversial in this sub. 

I’ve eaten stuff a lot of ppl in this sub probably didn’t know existed and have traveled to places ppl don’t see in a lifetime before going vegan. Yet, I stopped within the day I learned about the ethics behind veganism, a topic which I’ve seen many people quit Veganism without ever touching. In my personal life I’ve known some who quit after a year not even having ever heard of Kant (not that you’d need to, but anyone with introductory philosophy education would at least have this ring a bell). 

The biggest issue I have with this sub is that people accept subjectivism to a preposterous degree, where internally there is no reason to be compelled to take some other ‘subjective’ stance. Neither is this an argument of proof for objective ethics, but I suppose we can be objective that every time you gun down, cut, and butcher an animal it dies and likely experiences pain. 

The idea that opinions are equitable to what we consider ‘natural law’ like gravity, existence, is what pervades ppls minds. Because let’s be real, there are 2 basic facts that should make you de-facto vegan:

1. Killing animals for food is unnecessary 
2. Probably you and the vast majority of people reading have access to a lifestyle that lets you make ethical choices

It’s that simple. You have marginal cases where people willingly state they’d do slavery if it meant they’d have a better life. Those are not the people who participate in ethics to the degree veganism does. 

This turned into a rant, but it seems so many people who take baby steps never understand why people are compelled to quit overnight, nor explore *WHY* the difference between the two exists. It’s not that we don’t understand baby steps. Everyone has procrastinated. It’s because acknowledging basic facts are compelling, as well as acknowledging it’s plain simple reality",2022-04-06 08:33:56,2,vegan,CaesarScyther,comment,You don’t need baby steps
"It could potentially be easier to quit cold turkey. At least for other substances, it takes 72 hours for your brain to not become addicted. So for people quitting smoking or even cheese, stopping altogether might actually help them transition.

"I didn't have a goal to be vegan when I started my journey. It simply started with knowledge that eating meat is bad for the environment and animals such as pigs and cows are too smart and concious to be treated the way they do, so I stopped eating them. The more I dove into my change, the more I realised cutting things out of my diet is not hard to do. So extending it to other meat like chicken and fish was an easy step. Without even realising it, I became vegan! I think people need to find their own path towards veganism. Doing the switch from one day to another might not be for everyone because they might not have developped the connection between their eating habits and animal rights. My biggest turn around was realising my hypocricy of not eating beef, but continuing to eat dairy. That realisation was a huge factor that changed my mindset, and I don't know if just doing a sudden switch to veganism would have allowed me to have that realisation.",2022-04-06 13:59:09,1,vegan,RoseDuf,comment,You don’t need baby steps

For some people baby steps are much more sustainable especially when we are basically changing our entire diet plus everything else we purchase and consume. It’s a lot to think about.

"When people talk about ‘going vegan overnight’, it’s not about being perfect and puritan. That caricaturization is pretty insulting to the intelligence and empathy of the people who have been through it, and are going through it. Ten days in, ten years in, we all fuck up and learn something new every day. Every single one of us has to live with practical implications that mean we’ll never have a 100% animal product-free existence. 

So, it’s not about being perfect. It’s about actively going forward with the intent of following through with vegan values and actions. If you’re brand new to veganism and it all seems too difficult and overwhelming, then it’s time to start learning new things and flexing new muscles. How are you supposed to do that when you actively plan to continue to eat animals, to avoid learning what you need to learn to be successful? And why? So that you can say you didn’t actually ‘make a mistake’ or ‘fail’ because you always planned on eating animals all along?

We want you to go ‘vegan overnight’ because the ‘tapering off’ rarely happens the way you think it will in your head. You keep stringing yourself along for months and months because you will never feel ‘ready’. 

If you keep looking for a reason to eat meat, you’ll always find one. Every. Single. Time. You never say it’s ‘wrong’ - you planned to eat it. You’re always in transition. You never drew the line for yourself.

How long do you want to be out of control of your own actions? 

Is that really how you want to live? When you tearfully justify it, it sure doesn’t sound like it.

You can complain about judgemental vegans on the internet, but at the end of the day, you are the only one looking at yourself in the mirror. Nobody else has to deal with the consequences of your actions.

You’re only violating your own beliefs.

If you didn’t believe, you wouldn’t be here, would you? It’s easy to get offended and turn away from this community. It’s not hard to reject vegan beliefs, people do every day.

Nobody is forcing you to be vegan. You don’t have to impress anyone here. None of the people here matter.

You’re the one who is here and wants to be vegan. You believe it’s the right thing to do. So… why are you jumping through so many hoops and going out of your way to make sure you don’t actually do it? Why are you trying to convince other people to not do it?

also, if you happen to be eating less meat (even partly) for environmental reasons, here is one of several sources that counter the all-or-nothing attitude of vegetarian gate-guarders: this article from stanford discusses a paper exploring how by eating 25% less protein, as well as by changing 25% of the rest of their protein intake from animal to plant sources, americans could significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. i know this could be countered by the fact that of course not a majority americans will likely do this (at least anytime in the near future if at all), but i see it as more encouragement that doing something is far better than doing nothing - and by doing something, you are making a positive impact. so screw those people that shame flexitarians and such! https://earth.stanford.edu/news/qa-meat-health-and-environment#gs.plz1lw

Just don't get turned off by people who tell you there is something wrong with eating vegetarian sometimes/most of the time rather than all the time because it's still a good thing.

I would never describe myself as vegan or vegetarian, but my food is, so I wouldn't have any qualms posting it to veg subs, since it would be of intetest to the people here, and I do wish to encourage people to choose more veg options, just like I want to inspire myself to by browsing these subs.

"I personally started by cutting out beef and pork but I still ate poultry. Then one day I just didn't want it anymore. You have to do what works for you, there are too many people who are overjoyed to tell you exactly how to live your life.

People will give you crap about anything you do that's unlike what they do, I have no idea why but its basically inevitable. My family are always asking me if I'm ""still doing that vegetarian thing"" and my grandmother tries to convince me to eat the Christmas ham every year despite my not eating pork in 17 years. My vegan friends give me shit for ""half assing"" it. Fuck em. My diet is my diet and I will never piss all over someone else's choices, not sure why that doesn't seem to be the norm. 
So if you want to eat less meat, maybe try setting meatless days of the week, or meatless at home. Try out different options and see what suits you. I'd love to hear what you decide on, just for the same of my curiosity. 
I also reccomend checking out cookbooks, my favorite is how to cook everything vegetarian (my bible!) and there's another called double take that is just recipes that can include meat or be meatless.

"When I first went vegetarian, I first reduced to only chicken/fish, then only fish, then no meat (though still dairy/eggs). It turned out after I took the first step, it was really easy to take the second one. 

I did go back to eating fish when I started endurance triathlon/running, it was just easier for me to get what I needed - not to say that you can't and be veg, but it's a choice I made. When I got pregnant fish and a lot of milk/egg products made me feel sick, then after my baby was born seemed to also bother her, so for a while I was almost entirely vegan (not strictly so). I was able to reintroduce so I'm back to dairy/eggs but that step wasn't as bad as I thought either. (Being a new parent it's hard to find time to eat and I can't risk my milk supply, so reintroducing was more about convenience, again. Tough compromise but I had to be realistic.)

I'd say I eat vegan 10-25% of the time, vegetarian 75+% of the time, and fish 5% of the time or less. My spouse eats vegetarian maybe 50% of the time and eats whatever he wants the rest of the time.

"I would cut meat out entirely because as I've found with myself and with others, you get into sort of a ""I'm doing good enough"" and stop there type of mindset. If you're looking to cut meat out completely eventually, it might be easiest to do it right away. 

With that said, if you know yourself and know that wouldn't work, reduce it by half each week or month and eventually cut it all out if you were wanting to do that. ",2014-10-31 03:32:05,1,vegetarian,AnxietyAttack2013,comment,"Vegetarian vs. ""Flexitarian"""

"I was gradual, and I'm not nearly as strict as I used to be.  I call myself mostly vegetarian now.

I stopped eating meat first at home because it is much easier to choose what you eat when you are home.  Eating vegetarian, and especially vegan, is very difficult to do nutritiously when at certain restaurants and parts of the country.

So, then I stopped eating meat at restaurants and family events.  It is still occasionally difficult to find something to eat, even though I live in Philadelphia which is often among Top 10 Vegetarian cities in the US.  The difficulties usually come when I am out with family, or with friends I don't like very much...

/r/flexitarian is dead because no one who really cares also wants to be a flexitarian.  It would be like having a sub-reddit for semi practicing christians.  Christians who are semi-practicing not because they disagree with the church, but because they don't have the energy to do all the rituals. OK, technically that is probably most christians.

Anyway, I have a vegan mentality, but I am not vegan.  I believe that veganism is correct in that it is morally bad to utilize another living being for your own ends.  That said, I am not even a strict vegetarian anymore.  I haven't lost faith, but I'm definitely out of the fold.  My main difficulties come when I am drinking, or when I am out and there are no healthy and/or satisfying options.  It's hard that my friends are foodies when 90+% of foody food is not vegetarian.",2014-10-29 20:45:16,1,vegetarian,trashed_culture,comment,"Vegetarian vs. ""Flexitarian"""

I've met many people who've said that they would become a vegetarian but they don't think they can give up meat. I tell them that that's ok and they should consider cutting back instead. Just make any commitment they feel they can accomplish, whether that's only eating meat on weekends, every other day, or even just cutting it out of 1 day a week. Anything is good as long as it's a tangible commitment.

"I don't disagree that people need to eat less meat.  But why do we need to make another stupid word to call people who choose not to eat meat sometimes?  Isn't omnivorism the the default nutritional orientation for a human?  I know people eat a lot of meat but I would have to think for the most part on average for the world people regardless of their -ism eat more grains and vegetables than meat, except for some in the US of course. 

I think this is just an effort by the self righteous so they can say the are ""vegetarian"" sometimes, but everyone a ""vegetarian"" sometimes, there doesn't need to be another name to explain this eating habit.
