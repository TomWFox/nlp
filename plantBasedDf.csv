Third, this doesn't necessarily have anything to do with a lack of demand for the product.

"Don't partake in the Bill Gates hustle to get everyone to start buying plant based meat alternatives. The profit margins are great for the investments put in. To help out the public to understand why they need to switch over, Bill Gates is now trying to buy up as much of Americas farm and livestock grazing lands. This way he can monopolize the meat market by eliminating his competition and then tell the public, through the paid off media, that there is a meat shortage. This will drive up the price off all real meats. So he can release meat in limited supplies at a greater cost to the consumer and then steer us towards his plant based products. He hopes to keep this stunt up long enough period of time, in hope we learn to except his cheaply produced, high return alternative and also pushing it as very healthy way for us to eat and survive. This plan gives him big profits from both areas.. A big win win for him and a harsh lose lose for us. When he said he was going to use his money to give back to the american people, I knew that he was giving us a bunch of bull.. I didn't realize the bull he was selling was too expensive for me to put on my kitchen table. If his plan succeeds, we will soon be like the North Koreans, where the only part of the population that is allowed to obtain real meat are those that are working for the government or are serving a sentence in the military.",2022-01-09 09:27:54,2,pics,BombingTheBomb,comment,Ya'll would rather starve than eat plant based meat.

When Im buying food for the taste and could just get real beef, or a head of lettuce if I want.

"I don't get the hate tbh, I'm 100% for eating meat and will on a near daily basis but if a plant based alternative tastes the same I don't give a shit.

I tried the mcplant or whatever McDonald's calls it the other day and it was honestly indistinguishable to me, that being said McDonald's patties taste like the sole of a shoe so that's not much of an achievement.

Only thing I didn't like was the actual sauces and vegetables they picked but I guess its aimed at vegans and not idiots that like to test stuff, if it was a plant based big mac then I'd be down to get either.

People really let their perception get in the way of trying this stuff, it's honestly stupid because if you get the exact same thing from plant based meat as you do normal meat what is the problem?

I'm not a picky eater and genuinely can't tell the difference between plant based and meat, if the price was the same as normal meat I'd eat that all the time because of situations like this. 

KFC is supposed to be adding a plant based option for their chicken soon and I kinda can't wait to try it, people are so mad about a fucking option.

"Because they read the Forbes article about fake meats. Many recipes rely on complex layers of flavor and texture engineering that are designed to fit together like a Rube Goldberg machine. It’s what makes some vegan bacon sizzle when it hits the griddle and shrink up as it browns. “**It’s a very high-tech product, honestly,” says chief global flavorist Marie Wright**, who oversees one of the world’s largest flavor businesses at publicly traded Archer Daniels Midland. “These burgers, in some ways **they're highly processed** because you wouldn't be able to take pea protein from a pea and just, you know, miraculously make it into something that tastes like meat.”  
**The flavoring and fragrances industry is notoriously opaque, and these formulas are kept closely guarded, with top consultants rarely disclosing their clients. But as these much-hyped foods join more menus—just this week Impossible Foods announced it would launch across Disney parks while Beyond Meat disclosed it snagged a much-coveted test in Starbucks’** stores—it’s important to understand the details of how they are actually made. “2019 was a pivotal year,” Wright says. “Now everybody's talking about plant-based this, that, and the other. But really, after so much processing, can we really call it plant anything?”",2022-01-08 05:12:40,1,pics,ArtichokeEmergency18,comment,Ya'll would rather starve than eat plant based meat.

Personally I would opt for a vegetarian or vegan menu. It is generally going to be cheaper and healthier.

The *moment* I'm done barfing I feel better. Doesn't matter how I cook it. 

From researching online I am not unique but this seems very, very uncommon. It's too bad cause I really like the taste. Not more than real meat, but it's nice. Until the barfing.

"I've seen the store shelves cleaned out like this many times, but this really reminds me of when the lock down hit and people cleaned out the store shelves of everything.  There was NO fresh beef, pork or chicken,  so in the meat department there was a few packages of ground turkey, shit hotdogs made of chicken and turkey, and all these fake meat substitute products out to fill in the empty space in the meat department.  And there are all these few people like me who didn't participate in raiding the shelves, dumb struct looking around for protein to feed themselves and their family.

 I personally knew it was pretty bad before walking in, so I B-lined for the frozen meat section hoping to find SOMETHING. and I found the last couple bags (Total of 4 lbs) of store brand preformed frozen [80/20 hamburger patties](https://www.kroger.com/p/kroger-100-pure-ground-beef-quarter-pound-burgers/0001111060374).

"I \*only\* buy Beyond when I need (or just crave) burgers.  I'm not a vegetarian at all; I eat chicken and bacon and stuff.  I just prefer Beyond; it literally tastes better to me than ground beef.  

During Covid (middle of 2020) I had trouble getting Beyond (or Impossible) when ground beef was still readily available.  This may be the converse; that it's not necessarily a buyer preference so much as that the supply chain for Beyond and Impossible were fixed due to the 2020 shortages, but the beef supply was not and therefore ran out while these were successfully delivered to the store.  

Alternate explanation:  Beyond and Impossible can be easily frozen; perhaps this store had a large stock in their freezer?",2022-01-08 06:48:49,1,pics,ktappe,comment,Ya'll would rather starve than eat plant based meat. The winter snowstorm of 2022 - Nashville TN

"So. I know I’m blessed with an abundance compared to some, but I still appreciate my friend who helps a food donation place. When they pick new stock up from supermarkets, they have to sort it all and rotate out old stock or surplus they have no space for. Occasionally we get the odd bag of mince and so on, but regularly, and I mean almost weekly, we get copious amounts of vegetarian food. We currently have a drawer or two in our freezers, full, with enough meals to last my family for a week or two if we had to go without money. But the real benefit is my kids have been eating it, and even commenting after that it’s as fine as any meat. I’ve even become practically vegetarian, I still eat meat, but I can see the standards for ‘meat free’ foods has moved so far so soon that we could all switch today.
The annoying thing is how long it’s taken the price of these foods to settle down, and how cheap meat is still cheaper than this.

"I’ll just have to say it:

Yep, you’re right.

I am a meat eater but, for the sake of science, I tried Impossible, Beyond, and another one (can’t remember) when they got popular a couple years ago. Impossible was actually not bad, especially when cooked at a fast food joint. But… for whatever reason, they all had one major flaw… pre-colonoscopy-style diarrhea. Usually about an hour after eating, lasting for another hour.

Don’t know what it is… some sort of sensitivity or allergy to something in them, obviously, but I don’t know what exactly.

So yeah, I’d prefer to starve over the course of a few days rather than shit myself to dehydration and die… well… faster and with less dignity.",2022-01-08 02:04:02,1,pics,PM-ME-YOUR-THONGS,comment,Ya'll would rather starve than eat plant based meat. The winter snowstorm of 2022 - Nashville TN

"I have enough rice and beans to make it a couple months.  I've got enough flour for several months as well.  I'll make do.

Maybe one day plant based meat will taste good but it just doesn't.  I'd much rather eat rice and beans 7 days a week.  I've hardly eaten meat in weeks with the costs as they are.  I'll keep eating banyan until meat prices come down.

There are plenty of things that are good on their own without being fake.  Tofu ain't bad.   Tree's foot fungus tastes very nice.  Wild rice is great.  Lentils are very good.  Split peas are nice.  Peppers, onions, olives, okra, rhubarb, corn, tomatillos, the world is full of good non-animal products to eat.

Plant substitutes require high sodium, manufacturing processes to turn beans and grains into ""meat"", add in more sodium, sprinkle with dyes, etc... what is it that I'm actually eating that's not been processed into something it's not meant to be and filled with chemicals. If you don't want to eat meat, fine.  Break out the beans and rice.  Subsidies are found in all aspects of corporate agriculture,  meat, grains, producers,  etc.  You want to eat healthy, great.

"My wife started buying Impossible meat pretty consistently. I wasn’t a huge fan, and preferred real meat, but I largely think that was just inherit bias and my resistance to change.

I experimented for a year with every possible way to cook it, and if you love meat, here is my recipe for the best impossible burger you’ll ever eat:

1.	Buy Impossible meat
2.	Make into 1/4 lbs burger patties
3.	Get a dish, load with 3 parts Worcestershire sauce and 1 part Soy and mix it up
4.	Get some Slap Ya Mama’s seasoning pour it on top of the mix
5.	Take each patty and put it through the mix until it’s soaked, but before it’s falling apart
6.	Sprinkle Kosher salt on each patty
7.	Smoke burgers for 60-75 minutes at 225
8.	Take burgers off smoker and increase grill temp to 350-425
9.	Put burgers directly on grill for about 2-4 minutes per side and sear burgers
10. Continue until burgers reach 155 - 160 degrees.

I don't understand the panic buying. Just keep a big bag of rice 10lbs+ (per person if you're eating some every meal every day could easily give you a week) and some dried beans and you can survive for a long time. This bag of dried meat next of me is still good until the end of the year too. I don't get the whole panic buying stuff. Just keep some basic provisions around. If I felt like eating all the food in the cupboards I could probably avoid leaving the house for a few months. You know that stuff in the back that you don't eat because it's not your favorite or it's too much work/you bought it on a whim/bought in bulk.,2022-01-08 03:56:19,1,pics,ServileLupus,comment,Ya'll would rather starve than eat plant based meat.

My wife and I tried Beyond Burgers once a while ago and had to season it a pretty decent bit. I understand rat the formulas may have changed, but that's besides the point. I'm indifferent, but prefer real meat, she is not for it at all.

"Well, yeah. It's panic, not starvation. 

Also plant based meat tastes like shit. You can't prepare them the same way and the texture is a turnoff. 

My high school was part of an experiment to prove you can't taste the difference. We didn't even get to the cafeteria before noticing something was off. The smell was the first indicator, but it wasn't the first time they've botched cooking. Second, the way the light reflected off the ""meat"". It was almost... like freshly shined leather, or after you clean off your dashboard. Finally, the taste. It was... awful, offputting and made your stomach turn. This was in 2016 when fake meats were starting to take off. They may have improved since then, but fucking hell that was terrible. The only kid who liked the stuff was also the same kid who liked the spam we were given in history class. 

Some like it, but I'd rather eat plants than plant based meat.

"Would a vegan eat a plate of roast beef dyed green and red, then textured and arranged to look like a salad?

Fake meat. Which leads on to...

Fake food.

Nobody wants fake food.

Before anyone gets angry... I'm not passing a ""good / bad"" value judgment on that thought process. I'm just articulating it in hopes that it will then be more understandable.

ADDENDUM:

I've bought vegan impostor products. Not on purpose; bought some vegan ""cream cheese"" one time, the labeling of which pretty seriously obscured the fact that it was not real cream cheese.

The flavor and texture, on the other hand, made it extremely obvious. That shit was *nasty.*

"Lol!  Plant based ""meat"".  You forgot the quotes.  If it isn't animal flesh, it isn't *really* meat, now is it?

Why do vegans and vegetarians *insist* on trying to replicate the foods they choose not to eat?    When you make fake meat, because you *like* the taste, texture, whatever of meat, you are *validating* the rest of us who eat *actual meat*.  Why not use those ingredients to make *new things* that are *actually good?*  I mean, while you guys are trying to make black beans taste and feel like meat, *I'm* eating black bean preparations *that are so good I don't need some meat substitute to like it*.  Are you so addicted to eating animal flesh that you have to *pretend* to keep doing it to have gustatory fulfillment?

&#x200B;

Anyhow, yeah, if people aren't buying *whatever* is available, they don't *actually* have significant need that is unfulfilled.  If the store was out of fake meat, would the vegans have bought the real meat?",2022-01-08 06:48:00,-2,pics,LordRybec,comment,Ya'll would rather starve than eat plant based meat.

Why eat fake meat when you can eat good old honest grains and beans, that have sustained humanity since the dawn of times when meat wasn't available? Are people so dependent on meat they will eat anything out of a lab that looks like their old habits? 

Just go look at how 80% of Humanity eats now and has eaten for thousands of years. Meat isn't the main part of the meal but a side or one ingredient among others. These people have about one tenth of the chronic health problems people from rich countries have. Seriously.

Does she think that lions and tigers and polar bears and hawks and owls should also be extinct because they eat meat?? Like.... What the fuck?

Seven months isn't that long in the grand scheme of relationships, especially not compared to three years with a pet that loves you, depends on you for it's care and well-being, keeps you company, and is a companion to you.

"As a vegan who is the proud owner of a beautiful kitten, I understand it’s not possible for cats to thrive on a veg diet. She needs to understand this. Yes, as a human you can survive without meat and be perfectly healthy. CATS CANNOT!!! My entire of family of vegans can grasp this and I haven’t personally met anti-pet vegans so hopefully it’s a smaller group. 

You could try compromising and getting locally sourced meats that may be “more ethical” than mass produced cat food if it’s in your budget. However, if she won’t allow your cat to live a happy, healthy life with you, that would be very hypocritical and you don’t know what other aspect of your life she may try to control next.",2020-07-20 00:08:32,144,relationship_advice,sandtrap__,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

She does not. I repeat **does not** love animals. She’s doing this because her identity is tied into being a radical vegan, the same way anti-Vaxxers don’t actually give a fuck about health. She has low self esteem, and is a pathetic person. 

Heads up to everyone, PETA owns “kill shelters” because they don’t believe 1) animals should be owned 2) that there’s enough “good homes” in the world for all the animals in it. 

So they put down healthy animals. 

These are people with heads so far up their own self-righteous asses they think killing healthy animals are somehow better for them than giving them to loving homes.

I am vegan, have been for 5+ years and last year I adopted two cats. They eat meat, there's no safe way around it. And these cats would eat meat and the same amount of it whether I own them or not. Adopting animals is a great thing to do, they deserve love and care and a happy home. 100% I would dump anyone who insisted I give away my pets. My boyfriend, also a vegan, and super allergic to cats wanted to adopt our two beautiful kitties just as much as I did.

**Never let that happen.** 

I have a kitten named blackberry. I dated someone whom blackberry was apprehensive around: perhaps because of her judgmental attitude. She called her bitchberry. I confronted her about it, and she doubled down, not in a joking manner. 

The next day, we no longer dated. She was considerably more attractive than the type of woman I would expect given my socioeconomic status/own appearance. It doesn't matter. Some items are just off the table for polite discussion. You don't tell someone they have to get rid of their cat or start desecrating their loved ones early in a relationship in order for it to work. That's pathological.

Another question I think you should ask yourself is if you want to be dating someone who sees veganism as some moral high ground rather than empathy for animals or animal abuse.",2020-07-20 02:39:34,9,relationship_advice,luckypersimmons,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"Here we go again, human forcibly imposing their values on animal and on other human. It's ok to go vegan but to be a vegan nazi is just crazy. And the cat as an animal, has no free will to dictate it's own diet. It is in it's nature to eat meat. Does your girlfriend has issues too with other carnivores that eat meat like in Africa? Tiger, lion, hyena, are all evil meat eaters that should not exist? This has nothing to do with animal rights but more to do with these narcissistic people who wants to forcibly impose their belief and values on other people that is even more extreme than religious fanatics. This is a huge and a bright RED FLAG. Never get with someone that are forcing their belief and values onto you, even if it has to do with religion. Believe what you want but never try and force those beliefs onto others. She is just like a vegan Taliban or ISIS vegan. Save yourself and your cat.

"You got me at ""vegan"".

Unfortunately, due to loud, proud, and pretentious assholes, I am an ""anti-vegan"". Veganism is not ethical when you refuse to acknowledge the legitimate circle of life, and that each creature has a place in the world, as prey and predator. While I agree with the basic principles of cruelty-free living, everything dies, and I feel like nothing should die in vain - death should be for nourishment, safety, due to disease, and occasionally, old age. Wild animals rarely die of of age.

In regards to your situation: you made the right choice. Mittens did not have a choice in living or not living. You ethically gave Mittens the best, healthiest, and safest life possible (always feed meat, never grains, also avoid rice, veg is okay raw and cooked, but some animals have adverse reactions to certain plants/plant foods). Mittens does not know the bounds of your compassion, and vegans who want to eradicate an entire species, are not vegans. They're deranged. You avoided marrying a deranged human. Now you and Mittens can find a lovely, sane human, who shares your compassion, and live happily ever after.

FYI, you're not the only person in the world who started a relationship, hoping the other person's demands and hang ups eased the longer you were together.

"YOU CANNOT FORCE ANIMALS TO UNDERSTAND ETHICS! Anyone who gives a fuck about animals doesn’t want them to starve, and be unhealthy. I’m sorry! You never give up an animal for anyone. That’s all I’ll say. As a huge animal advocate, it’s simply ridiculous to consider the extinction of domestic animals. A lot of science points to the fact that animals self domesticate- its a trait they gained (specifically with dogs and certain foxes). The friendly gene. In fact, dogs are the only animal currently that can release the same type of oxytocin when looking into their owners eyes as humans do with loved ones and family- and their children. Isn’t that wild?

Further, I’m not against vegans. It seems like a different type of animal cruelty to me to wish for an entire breed to go extinct. That’s a fucking joke- i’m sorry, this would be a major deal breaker for me. And I’ve fostered and rescued for 15 years. There is straight up no world currently available for all the animals that need and require love from humans. And there’s nothing wrong with that. To want to 100% remove the circle of life from all animals is completely insane.

"Story time! Once upon a time, I was dating a man. Said man told me that he was allergic to cats and I would have to get rid of mine before he moved in. I told this man that any person who loves me and lives with me must also be okay with cats. My cats and I are a package deal, the end, and if he couldn't do that then he could kick rocks. 

Two months later, he spends the night and discovers he's magically only a tiny bit allergic; maybe he can live with cats after all, he supposes, maybe I'd consider just dogs after these get old and pass? 

Fast forward to today: we're making plans for our wedding anniversary in a few weeks, he's bribing the littlest one with treats, and fondly talking about how excited he is that he can help pick out and raise our next kitten so it'll imprint on him too, and he can get in on the zany kitten playtime antics and cuddles he missed out on with OUR cats. 

Hold the line, OP! If she's worth it, she'll come around. If not, just think of all the time you're saving yourself not having to waste months or years on someone who cannot respect your love for your pet. Remember, this isn't really about veganism: it's about her respecting your feelings and attachments. If she can't do that, then she's not as great as you thought she was anyway and you're better off.

"Uhhh, it doesn't sound like this is about veganism. Just like most people on the extreme side of things, it's less about tolerance and more about abiding by their ideologies without questioning them.

This obvious she just wants control, and if she's in the younger stages of veganism, I think it's important that you put some thought to what other aspects/components of your life she might crack down on simply because she doesn't agree and gets mad if you don't conform. If she's willing to put your relationship on the line over a disagreement, that isn't healthy and will subsequently become a very toxic relationship.

Relationships are about love. Love is about tolerance and acceptance, and coming to terms on things you disagree with. It's one thing to be against you being a thief  and another thing to be against you having a cat (that does no harm to the environment, directly or indirectly). Unfortunately that's the world we live in, and things will never go our way. Humans will always eat fish and we will always eat meat. That is out of our control. What IS in our control is choosing NOT to partake.

"I usually don't weigh in on topics in this thread because I feel like I'm not usually in a place to be giving any advice, however, this time I think I should make an exception.

Your girlfriend is an asshole, and believes that the way she feels life should be is the only option.  This tends to happen with many people who gravitate to things like extreme dieting, exercise, politics, religion, etc, because of the morality of the concept, rather than how it can benefit their life.  Your girlfriend is upset at the concept of people eating meat?  Fine, she doesn't have to partake, she's doing her part, but the second she starts forcing that way of life on others, she's an asshole.  She already made you give up something just to be with her by urging you away from being pescitarian.  And unlike humans (who are the only creatures in the known world that give a damn about the morality of eating meat), cats are animals, and animals function in instinct, not morality.

So, to sum up, your girlfriend is an asshole, she cares far more about having her personal beliefs catered to by others than she does a out you or anything else, and if you let her get away with it, you're essentially conceding that she's right, which you shouldn't do.

"There's already really good advice posted, so I'll try to cover something else.

Her take on living cruelty-free is not only illogical and false, but quite immoral in my eyes as well.

First of all, life has never been and will never be cruelty-free. Not for humans, not for any other animal. It will never be achievable and that's a good thing. Too much of anything is bad for us, even that which is perceived as good (ideology seems like a fitting example here).

Second of all, how does you giving away the cat solve the problem of the cat eating meat? In that case she should advocate for killing your cat (and all carnivores). Then we run into another illogical stance, because what does that make her if she adcocates for taking another life? Kinda cruel. She's just completely in the wrong here. She needs to grow up.

On top of that, there's a lot of focus on whether or not eating meat is cruel. What about the emotional bond that your cat has with you, and that you have with your cat? Personally I don't think there's ever a valid reason to move a pet from its family unless it is aggressive towards family members or someone is terribly allergic.

We don't give away our children to someone on craigslist because we don't approve of something the kid has done. Seems like the cruel-free way to be more inclusive and treat our pets like family members and not some attraction with an expiry date.

All in all, she knew you had a cat when you met. She decided that she is good at manipulating people (obvious that she never heard ""no"" in her life), decided to string you along until she thought you were ready to submit to her will. 

My best friend's SO of 7 years is vegan. Never has she ever made ultimatums or tried to manipulate him into becoming vegan. She has made friendly encouragements. He mostly eats a vegan diet now, but he will still eat meat a couple of times each week. She's not a fan of him eating meat, but she would never shame him or anything and she understands him. She's grateful that he's making an effort.

That's what you should strive for in your next relationship. Easy compromises on both sides that aren't forced and a level of mutual respect. Please don't stay with someone as manipulative and controlling. It will just get harder to leave because then there's more time and memories that's at stake. Your friends and family are next after your cat. Prepare for the ""honey, I want to move to place X."" which conveniently enough is an 8 hour drive from anyone you know. Are you really going to oppose to that after having already spent a year together and gotten rid of your cat? It's the same psychological reaction that gamblers get to a losing streak.

"Giving up mittens isn’t going to stop the meat consumption she is responsible for. Just means you’re not ‘responsible’ for it. I get not wanting to contribute to the meat industry yourself.

In this day and age, while there are ways to reduce your impact like buying locally-grown ect, it is almost impossible to live completely cruelty free with out going off the grid on a homestead.

"Well, I know you said you're not going to give away Mittens, but perhaps a perspective that may help your girlfriend understand what she's asking:

As a vegan, she advocates for a cruelty-free life, or at least an existence where one isn't harming animals. However, her asking you to give away Mittens is distinctly harmful for Mittens; rather it is cruel to ask you to upheave Mittens' life for the sake of your girlfriend. Now, I'm sure she's advocating you giving Mittens' to an animal shelter, but it still doesn't make sense because while animal shelters try their best to take care of animals well, they are often limited in resources and cannot provide all the necessities for animals. If you were to give Mittens to another person, it still does not stop the fact that Mittens is still alive and potentially out there killing rodents. The only real solution to her issues is to throw Mittens out into the wild (where Mittens is still killing mice), or to kill Mittens (which is cruel). Following the non-cruelty logic, the most reasonable option is keeping Mittens and mitigating Mittens' unnecessary hunting.   


Moreover, asking an animal that is naturally a carnivore to transition to a vegetarian diet or vegan diet can be considered cruel and unusual in many circles since you're forcing your animal, who is mostly reliant on you for food, to go against their natural diet, especially in the case of Mittens who has some digestive issues.   


Basically, tl;dr; for someone who is anti-cruel, your girlfriend is being very cruel in her stance. I'm very sorry for the situation you're in, and I hope that maybe some of these comments may stick with her and help you reach a compromise with your GF.

"I am a vegetarian, but my boyfriend is very much not. He has a cat and I have a rabbit. I love the cat practically as my own child. It is my choice to not eat meat, but I'm not going to sit here and force him or the cat to not eat meat. I can understand the mentality of not wanting to be apart of the meat industry, but I also know unless under VERY extreme dietary allergies / circumstances that vegan diets are not realistic / best for cats and dogs. But that is why I chose to stick to ""plant based"" diet animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs because I feel comfortable providing a good life for them.

Yes, my boyfriend feeds the cat a raw diet and the meat that we feed her grosses me out, BUT that would never stop me from feeding the cat when he isn't available to. I want a cat myself and I would never deny that cat the best diet I can provide for it. If she didn't want to be apart of that aka not feed the cat because of her own mortals that is her right. But it is also your right to have the pet you want and provide the best diet and life for the pet.

Cats are carnivores and should be fed a diet that includes meat.

"A few things stood out to me. 

(1&2) You said she is amazing and you're super compatible yet she changed your diet for her and stated you're known as ""the vegan couple""--you're stating why others may think you're a good couple yet not why you think you are. Also someone trying to control your diet is a major sign of them controlling you; there are healthy diets that are not vegan.

(3) She belongs to a group advocating to kill off domesticated cats. You love your cat. Cats are beautiful and sweet and animals deserving love. There are other ways to help fix the domesticated animal industry. 

She seems to be rather extremist. She also seems to be trying to control you. Think again about what you find so compatible. Are these your words or hers or someone else's when you think about how great you are together?

"Do not get rid of your cat and don’t be afraid to stand up to her. If your girlfriend wants you to get rid of your cat just because your cat is on a regular diet, don’t listen to her. You’re caring for your cat and you shouldn’t give her away just because your girlfriend wants to. If you do give your cat away, you’re going to be sad in a way.

"It's not about the cat, it's about control. Sorry to say but your gf sounds nutters, and it seems like she's been slowly conditioning you over the course of the last 7 months to comply to her every demand. She already has complete control of your diet, now she's trying to dictate your pets? What other things have you changed in your life solely to suit her?

This is how it starts. Next things escalate into arguments about who you can see, what brands or people you can or can't support, where you can or can't go because those places don't share her values, etc., and before you know it, you'll be living your entire life walking on eggshells, and throwing out everything you love to please a control freak. Is that really something you want for yourself long term? Unreasonable demands, ultimatums, and temper tantrums from your partner when you happen to have a difference in opinion about something?

I know you care for your gf, but she's just showed you that she cares more about her own agenda and ""being right"" (in her mind)  than she cares for you, or for a LIVING creature that she KNOWS is precious to you. That's not something to take lightly.

">she did not see a future with me unless I was willing to give away Mittens        
       
Human relationships come and go, the loving relationship with your loving companion Mittens will remain your joy until the end. You love Mittens, and you have a duty to love and care for her. Your GF is putting her extremist views before your love for Mittens and your rights in the relationship. She obviously knows how you feel about Mittens, and doesn't respect your love for her. She's trying to control the relationship and who you love as well.   
If this is how things are going to go in the relationship, then feel lucky that you have an opportunity to end it now, rather than getting rid of Mittens and living with that agony and severe guilt after the relationship ends in a year or two. Even if your GF lets you keep Mittens, will you ever be able to trust that she will ever have Mittens best interest at heart, and not *lose* her? Sad I know, but true.    
Lose the vicious girlfriend...it'll hurt a lot, but you'll mend and move on.

"The real problem here isn't her 'cruelty-free values'- as you said, tons of vegans have pets.  It's that from what you've said, _you've_ been making all the big sacrifices in this relationship in order to live up to _her_ standards.

You went vegan _for her sake_.  You spent more time at her place, _for her sake_.  And now she wants you to traumatize and abandon a loved one, _for her sake_.  I know you said something about how the first two weren't big deals- but dietary habits, living situation, and pet ownership? Those are high-priority issues when it comes to compatibility with your partner. And the fact is, it doesn't sound like she's compromising; she's just insisting that _you_ change to meet _her_ standards.

If she's not willing to compromise on pets even when you already _have_ a cat, then imagine what she'll be like on other things.  If you got offered your dream job but had to move away, would she come with you? Or would she make it another ultimatum? If you had to take in a family member who'd fallen on hard times, would she be willing to make concessions and accommodate them, or insist that they stay somewhere else? If you have friends who 'eat flesh' as she says, would she be able to play nice with them because they're your friends, or would she go off whenever she saw them eating a sandwich?

Compromise needs to happen in any healthy relationship, and it sounds like it's just not happening much here.

Sadly, better to just end things either way here, because now that she's revealed her true colors... well, I'd never really feel comfortable leaving her alone with my cat.  I'd be very worried that Mittens would one day ""accidentally"" escape out the front door, or eat something that makes her sick.",2020-07-20 17:35:53,2,relationship_advice,Princess_Moon_Butt,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"I don't understand how someone can claim to be vegan because they don't want other animals to be in pain however would suggest that you give up Mittens who is obviously attached to you and therefore will be sad and confused if he has to suddenly be sent away? It's not like she'll stop eating meat anyway? It's a very stupid thing for your gf to ask for and seems to me to be some sort of test or a power move.
I understand it's difficult to give up this relationship however if she doesn't listen, there is nothing you can do. Giving up your cat isn't an option and even if you consider doing it at the back of your mind, it will ruin your relationship forever as you will not be able to stop resenting your gf. 
Even if she does change her mind and agrees to keep Mittens, I think this raises a huge red flag and you should have a serious discussion about what this was all about. Also looking at her extent of wanting control, she might just do something like ""accidentally"" let Mittens get away if you do end up moving in together.

I know many vegans who feed meat to their pets. Why? Because being a vegan is YOUR choice. But it's a choice that, as an omnicerous primate, you can make.

"That sounds like a mental health issue. She is showing an incredible lack of empathy towards you and a frankly an irrational misunderstanding of how life on Earth works.   
Veganism is a **personal** ethical choice. Once you start proselytizing and demand other people conform to your beliefs, you're into wacko religious territory.   
Don't try to make your carnivorous pet a vegan. That's animal cruelty. You will have to hand back your passport to Vega. If you think it is acceptable to foist your personal choices on another species then you really shouldn't have a cat.    
Now, it is important to be a responsible cat owner. Cats belong inside houses - if you let them out they cause terrible damage to local wildlife - they are an invasive species...  If you do that, then you're doing all you reasonably can.  
So, if neither of you will compromise, you're done. Split up and move on. It takes time if you care about each other, but the alternative for you is to give in to an ultimatum... The first rule of relationships is when someone demands you choose them or someone else (even if the someone is a cat)... always choose the someone else. Anyone who actually loves you will accommodate your friendships and other loves and work around them.",2020-07-20 14:47:39,2,relationship_advice,Torodong,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"Gonna drop a bomb here: being vegan isn't even being vegan. Being vegan increases the demand for a lot of foods and products that are grown in South America.

This results in mass deforestation for new land and product, resulting in the murder of multiple thousand animals, fish, bugs, and plants, which are also still a living thing.

"I know this is super late and is going to get hella buried, but I'll say what I want to say anyways:

Have you ever heard of the ""honeymoon phase"" of a relationship? It's when you first meet, you're crazy about one another. Always wanting to spend every moment with eachother, thinking the person is absolutely perfect and you'd do anything to please them. This usually goes away after a few months but can last longer. With time, you see your partner for how they actually are when they're beginning to get comfortable with being around you and are letting their true personality and habits show. 

This is where you are in the relationship, juuust getting out of the honeymoon phase. You've been dating for only 7 months, but have already made big lifestyle changes for her, and are planning on moving in together already. Now she's demanding you get rid of your cat for... no real good reason, just because she doesn't like cats. She's showing you more of her true personality here. 


Anyways speaking of cats, her argument is the stupidest shit ever. ""We should kill all cats because animals had to die for their food, which means they're bad""... like, what? Does she feels the same way about dogs? Snakes? Fish? Sure dogs are technically omnivores, but they're usually a heck of a lot healthier if they eat both meat and veggies. 

Do cats have to be vegan too now? A non-sentient beast that has absolutely no concept of veganism and couldn't care less if a chicken had to die for its meal? A being that will *literally die if it doesn't fucking eat real meat*? Ok so cats have to be released now... but wait, that'd wreak havoc on ecosystems worldwide so that won't work. And there's problems with just... Killing em all too. As strange a concept as it is, there *is* such a thing as working cats, mainly on farms and on ships to help deal with vermin (which such pests would be a huge problem if the world was to go vegan) Plus cats, along with dogs have been found through studies to have a very beneficial effect on one's mental health.


It's fine if someone doesn't like cats or pets in general, but that begs the question: Why would you knowingly enter a relationship with someone that has a pet when you have such a strong dislike for it? My hunch is that she found you to be a bit of a pushover, so she decided to make a power-play. As so many people here have said vegan or not, this chick just ain't worth giving up poor Mittens over.

Humans domesticated cats, we did this to them, and it’s now our job to take care of them.

I just don’t understand this logic, and I used to be vegan/vegetarian. Is your girlfriend aware that plenty of animal species, naturally existing in this world, require meat to survive?

"For context, I'm 34/m, vegan and have two cats

If my girlfriend and I were about to move in together and she were allergic I would look to rehome my cats.

If my girlfriend were scared of cats I would look to gradually acclimatise her to them.

If my girlfriend simply hated all cats I would politely point out these were my cats and she was welcome to have nothing to do with them, but they stay.

Cats are obligate carnivores, so must eat meat. Given that, your options are either to kill your cat or for her to continue to eat meat. Since that is true, what exactly does your girlfriend see as the point of you rehoming your pet?

She is correct about the murder quality of our pets, which is why I keep mine indoor only. 

I would say to your girlfriend that your pet is a member of your family and non-negotiable. I would ask her whether she believes your pet deserves to die because of her extremist inflexibility. 

If she says yes, then.. is that really someone you see as a life partner? Someone with that degree of stubborn selfish uncompromising opinion? 

If she says no then ask her what point is there in ripping this member of your family away from her home, making her and you miserable for absolutely zero change in animal welfare apart from a traumatised cat and human?

"Vegan with a cat here. No offence but your gf I think is a bit misguided. Cats are predatory animals and need meat so as such. Like all non-human animals, they don't have morals like us. They're bred to be hunters and keep rodents under control. Without them, rodents would run wild and out of control. I suggest you show her the wolves of Yellowstone and the effect they had on the environment. Animals are more connected to nature than we are and what they do is intended to keep the balance. Prey animals keep vegetation under control, without them eco systems would get overrun. Predators keep them under control but when predators start killing too many, they don't have their food to survive and the predators start to die out to let the prey animals repopulate. It's seriously amazing when you look deeper into it. But anyways, your cat isn't doing anything wrong and even if it had morals, it still wouldn't be doing anything wrong because it's an animal. Yeah it sucks that predators have to kill but that's nature. Humans have the morals and evolutionary benefit of choosing our diet and examining our lifestyles. To force that on animals is in itself, not vegan. She's taking some fantasy where nothing has to kill or die and putting it into the real world which just isn't possible. 

I know this might be crossing a line but if you want me to talk to her, send me a private message. Ive been vegan a good while and ran an activist group in my city revolving around animal rights. I've met people like this before and it's always some fantasy or idea that animals should choose a vegan diet and are evil otherwise that seems to influence this anti-predator sentiment. 

If she isn't willing to allow mittens to stay, then she has to go. Mittens is completely innocent in this and doesn't deserve to suffer because your gf is misguided in her beliefs.",2020-07-20 15:09:44,2,relationship_advice,,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"7 months is stil the honeymoon period, don’t rush into moving in until at least after the first year. You need to know for sure if this is right for you. Besides the fact you adjusted your diet to her request, I would encourage you to look a bit more carefully at your relationship over these past 7 months. Is this the only thing (besides the Mittens issue) that you have had to compromise on. Has she made any adjustments for you? Has her behaviour been mirroring your in most cases? By this I mean does she agree with you about everything or does just not say anything ? If she is mirroring then you are falling for someone who only agrees based on your view and not what she really thinks and feels. If she expects you to make all the changes (Eg. even if you really don’t give a shit about whether there are going to be blue curtains in the new planned shared home, does your opinion even get considered when it matters?) , then this is giving you a taste of what to expect in your life together.

The fact she kept this significant expectation about the cat from you means she hasn’t been honest about her true feelings,thoughts or intentions about you. You may have fallen for her public face not her true face. Her relentless attack on you about the cat that you are not backing down about, this is more about her trying to exert control back of you, she will try being nice and alternate with being angry again. She will try everything to get you to agree to her terms. The problem is if she does back down about this, expect your cat to disappear or for the cat to just attack her out of the blue that she will then scream is your fault even though she antagonised the cat. 

You are both young, and it sounds like this is your first real adult relationship. Painful as it is, the longer you stay in a controlling relationship the harder it gets to make the break. Especially when children enter the picture. Remember this : when a person tells you who they are, believe them. 

I would also ask this question when she talks about you, does she talk more about how you make her feel  her wants and needs ; or about you, and how awesome you are? If it is all about how she feels, and what she gets from the relationship then, you unfortunately do not truly matter to her.

"Bud, this ain't about a cat. It's about controlling you. I realize you think you've got a good thing going but that behavior isn't healthy. 

Furthermore, cats are carnivores. Full stop, they need meat. What you're doing, sourcing from reputable brands is exactly what you need to be doing. 

Lastly, that cat has a bond with you, if you give it away, you break that bond. I've seen some dogs that were broken because an owner gave them away. I think cats bond in a similar fashion. It's cruel to do that to an animal. 

The way I see it, you've got two options. 1. You break it off. A 7 month relationship, even one that got through a pandemic, is not enough time to learn enough about a person. If you stay together, you can look forward to having this exact discussion numerous times. 

2. You sit her down and have an adult discussion. She won't like it, but you might be able to make things work. Best of luck if you try it. Personally, I'd break it off.",2020-07-20 14:49:48,2,relationship_advice,Janneyc1,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"“Because they hunt mice and eat meat.”

That is not a vegan complaint.  That is virtue signalling gone wrong.  Conscientious vegans would never expect a natural carnivore to a) not exist, and b) stop eating meat.

This seems to be a recurring control issue.  She seems to be purposefully eroding your agency for her own benefit.

This is where you two go to counselling, together as a couple, and her for her fear of cats you referenced up top, and her controlling behavior.

It may be, that despite the things you really like about her, that maybe this relationship was always destined to stay casual.

"As a vegan, let me tell you that your girlfriend is not sane. Do not give away Mittens. 

I have a fluffy little fella myself and while he’s an obligate carnivore, that doesn’t make me less of a vegan. Some brands locally source meats, and often, the meats going into cat and dog food are parts that can’t be given to people/excess/or parts that people just don’t want to eat. That’s okay. 

The more local and small batch the company, the more likely it is that they’re getting all this from local farms + meat isn’t the only thing in cat food. But she seems to not know that. Cats also do eat veggies and fruits (although not essential to their diet). My boy will eat strawberries, avocado, tofu, mango, coconut yoghurt, etc. I don’t know why. But he loves them. He also loves nori (which provides him with amino acids his body can’t produce on its own).

Either way, keep doing what you’re doing. You’re responsible for Mittens, a companion of yours who you love.

"This is some weird backwards PETA thinking if I ever heard it. She seems more concerned for chickens than the well-being of your (and arguably any) pet cat (assuming she is actually concerned and isn't just using veganism as an excuse). Has she ever expressed opinions that pet-ownership in general is unethical for any reason? What is her opinion on wild, predatory felines (lions, cheetahs, tigers, etc)?

I'm not going to pretend that house-cats are incredibly environmentally friendly (outdoor domestic cats kill more wildlife every year than almost any other animal on Earth), but almost nothing in this world is. Existing itself means we take up natural resources. The important part is reducing how much we have to take, reusing what we can, and not abusing when we do have to take.

Assuming she does compromise, you guys make up, and you guys aren't childfree and want to have a future and family together, is she not going to let your children eat ""flesh""?

That said due to our society there are many dogs and cats in need of homes whom I am happy to adopt and give them better lives. If you are a vegan and not comfortable feeding a carnivore meat then don’t get a carnivore pet. Dogs and cats need meat. Don’t get rid of the cat for the GF get rid of the GF for the cat.

Also I don’t think giving the cat away does anything. Put it in the scenario of: even if you WERE to give it away to someone else, it’s not like it’ll stop eating meat. All I’m saying is, be glad you’ve noticed these signs so early in the relationship. Personally, I’d break it off, as painful as it is; but if you want to work something out, I would take her to therapy since her way of thinking doesn’t seem healthy.

"Bro, I’m a hardcore preach vegan. I’m the guy everyone wants to shut up. Even I think getting rid of the cat is ridiculous for her to ask.  Veganism is about people morals towards animals. Not animal morals towards animals. You can’t mess with nature. Plan and simple. A cat can not live without meat. You’re being a good vegan by loving it and giving it home. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this. You sound like a cool dude. And congrats on being vegan. You’re doing the right thing.

"I don’t think your girlfriend was that great. “You have to eat meat to get to the next level with me” “you have to give up your cat to get to the next level with me” What’s next? Did you ask her to give up anything? Maybe next would’ve been “You have to walk away from your family to go to the next level with me, they’re not vegan (no idea) and they don’t do vegan laws x y and z.” You just don’t know it seems like she’s using this just to get you to do what she wants.

Always pick the cat (or dog). What’s funny is vegans are fine with having a cat, or are supposed to be. It doesn’t violate anything. Buying a pet is against their beliefs because it may be supporting things like puppy mills.

"OP I feel for you! I briefly dated someone vegan. He was happy to prepare vegan food and teach me some recipes, which I was excited about as all the foods he made were delicious. We ran into the same issue though. I had a pregnant stray pop up at my house about a month in. Because I brought her inside the local shelter wouldn't take her, as they saw this as adoption. It turns out that other shelters a few towns over still would have taken her, but I hadn't checked with them yet. The guy, who had always been so calm and even tempered, although passionate about animal cruelty and the way he ate and why..He. Freaked. Out! I was contributing to animal cruelty by taking her in, I still don't really understand his logic on this as I planned to get her fixed and her kittens fixing contracts on adoption, he said that he would pay to HAVE HER PUT DOWN! That if I wasn't going to do the right thing ( because killing her and her kittens was morally correct somehow???) Then he would come and get her while I was gone and do what I was too cowardly to do, and that's a direct quote. At that point in my life I had a really difficult time with conflict and was more of a go along to get along kind of person, but the absolute rage I felt at the thought of him killing this tiny, pregnant kitty that I had nursed back to health pushed me to respond more harshly than I normally would. I told him that he was sick, and cruel, and that if he touched my cat in any way without permission I would file theft charges ( it turns out that that was actually an option as pets are considered property. All those years of mock trials in high school served me well, lol.) I told him that we were %100 done, and to lose my number. I left, but the next day when a neighbor told me they saw him skulking around with a Humane catch and carry cage I printed out an official looking cease and desist letter and taped it to his door below a giant sign I made that said that killing a cat because he was against animals being killed was delusional. My artsy friend drew a cartoon caricature of him praying at a cow altar with a slaughtered kitten in his hands. It was a real work of art if I do say so myself! And apparently also very effective as I didn't see or hear from him again. 
Keep the lovely Mittens OP, your sweet pet will love you unconditionally while your GF apparently won't. Let her know that you came into the relationship with Mittens and she knew that you were a package deal, just as her and her veganism was. If she can't come around to understanding that you would not ask her to change her diet because she's passionate about it, that it's unfair and not logical to ask you to give up your pet which you are passionate about. Rehoming your cat would not change her diet, so the request makes no sense and is absolutely unfair. Good luck OP, if it doesn't work out with your GF there are plenty of pet loving women out there who will be happy to take her place!",2020-07-20 21:14:01,2,relationship_advice,memeelder83,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"Wtf, it's ok to kill an animal because it needs meat to survive, but it's not ok to eat any meat.  Does not make any sense.  All animals deserve to live, and part of the life cycle is some animals eatting others. It's nature, and necessary. If there were no predators to hunt herbivors, then they would breed out of control and then start starving to death as food became scarce.  

There was actually a park that had almost no wildlife, plants were half dead, and a pack of wolves was introduced.  And more birds came back, plants that haven't been seen in years were able to grow. Etc.

Lots of herbivores will still injure and kill each other and other animals, either accidentally or intentionally. Does she hate all animals? What about people?

"How will giving away Mittens make Mittens eat less meat?

How will doing anything short of killing Mittens or making Mittens sick make Mittens eat less meat?

It seems like putting Mittens down just to make one person more comfortable or save a romantic relationship would be a violation of vegan principles, so I imagine that's not an option. If it was an option, the person for whom it was an option would be a monster.

Anyway, all that means the available ""vegan option"" and non-animal-cruelty option is Mittens continues to eat meat. So why can't you keep your cat? If you aren't facilitating Mittens having kittens, your girlfriend's argument is ""I like you, but I don't like cats. Get rid of your friend.""

If she thinks domestic cats should be extinct, does she also think the human race should be? We kill more animals AND fellow humans. Or does she just think that specific people (non vegans and murderers?) should die?

The logic is flawed. Your cat needs to live, and it needs meat to do so. The choices that you have, as a cat owner, go as far as *what* specific type of meat, where it's sourced etc., You shouldn't choose if the cat shouldn't have meat.",2020-07-20 22:51:19,2,relationship_advice,emmahar,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"You should try to see it from her point of view.  I don't think she's changed her mind about the cat or wants it to become vegan or anything; she's changed her mind about you.  You are now both considering making a big step to move in together, it's a vote in confidence for you.

Obviously being vegan is an integral principle in her life.  She made a decision to consume zero meat, by including a cat in her life everyday she will have to bear the indelible paw mark of meat being consumed in her house.  Besides you fairly admit she's never hidden away her dislike for cats.  

She also made the point at the start about living with cruelty-free values.  Most people see a cat as a non-objectionable cute and furry animal, and like to project their own feelings onto the animal.  Cats are unquestionably cruel - just watch one toy with a mouse and get bored with it.  A dog would rather starve than eat their owner, cats are well know to start chowing down on their owner within hours of death.  

She is being upfront and honest about it - and frankly more mature about it.  She's not asking you to drown the cat in a bag - just that you find Mittens a new home.  It's a compromise and not a controlling action.  From her point of view it is a reasonable request to ask; and to comply with such a request is a show of strength and a strong indication you care for her feelings in the matter and are mature enough to make a compromise for the relationship.  

One thing I can guarantee you is that if you insist on keeping the cat - there will be no hope of any future with her.  I know it doesn't sound fair, but she's already made her decision.  If she's not important enough to you to get rid of the cat - you've made your decision too.",2020-07-20 22:50:03,2,relationship_advice,panad0lsandwich,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

Two individuals get in a relationship where there are compromises but there is individuality as well. If she’s vegan that’s is her choice  and she should not compel you to make any decisions to conform to her way of living. You were an individual before you got with her and still are one. You’ve had your cat longer than you’ve been with your gf. Hopefully you guys can talk it out and figure something but from personal experience once a problem it’ll always be a problem.

on a personal note humans and animals are meant to live side by side  in my opinion, even if some of them like us just cause we are warm i feel like i have a deep connection with all the critters of the earth and its sad that someone can judge a wild animal based on the way it has evolved to survive, i really dont get how your GF can come to her conclusion on that topic.",2020-07-20 22:36:23,2,relationship_advice,Snoo45371,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

Vegans love and care about animals. Cats are animals and the only humane thing is to let them eat meat because that's what is natural and healthy for them to eat.- 

It's true, domestic cats can be a menage for ecology as they are known to kill a lot of endangered species such as bats and dormice. But that's because their owners are careless and let them 'hunt' frealy. It doesn't sound to me that you are allowing your cat to do that, so what is the problem?

You don't ask someone to abandon their loving child, parent, dependant etc. and a domestic cat is part of the family. I suspect you feel similarly, that's why you won't even consider getting rid of your cat.

I'm sorry for your pain, but this relationship doesn't seem to be worth saving. She hid the fact that she didn't want a cat for a few months and her reasons are immature at best. Plus, it's just cruel, as I state above, to ask someone to dump their loving one for HER personal beliefs.

"Cats are natural carnivores. They have to eat meat. I’m not vegan but my way of thinking is this... most people are vegan because they vouch and respect animals. If you love animals so much, how could you take away from an animals natural ability to eat the things they hunt? In my opinion, she is trying to be completely controlling. That is toxic because it is only starting out this way. She is going to get worse as things go along and I would take this as a red flag. I know many vegans who have cats and feed them meat because they know that naturally, in the wild, that is part of their diet. I understand you feel like you might be missing out on a great relationship, but I think she is showing some red flags right now that you should really think over. As for your cat, I would not get rid of the cat. Even if it meant getting rid of her. Don’t judge- be very firm. If she had a problem with the cat, she would have said it in the beginning.

"I'm sorry but this is crazy. She is against cats because they are carnivores? I'm sorry but cats don't choose to be carnivores and there are ways to prevent them from hunting other animals like putting a bell on them or keeping them indoors. Your girlfriend is not being logical and is only looking at the small picture about cats than seeing how you can prevent the cat from eating animals. Unfortunately cats eat meat, they need it to survive and they are very loving creatures. I have 3 cats and they are my babies, if my boyfriend told me to choose between him and my cats I'd choose my cats.

I'm not vegan but I am not against vegans, but some vegans don't look at the bigger picture and just jump into conclusions and only do research about cats being bad rather than researching on how they can keep the cat from killing. If your girlfriend really loves you she'd think of you first rather than her ideology and to listen to what you have to say, that Mittens can't eat vegan cat food because of her digestive problems and that there are ways to keep her from killing, explain to her that if she really loves you she wouldn't choose ideology over you. I would never choose my beliefs over my boyfriend, but that doesn't mean I'll change them to make him happy, instead we come to an understanding of something if we don't understand.

If she says ""I can't be with you because cats are carnivores"" then find someone new. Cats are animals too, and excluding them from the animal kingdom just because they are carnivores doesn't seem like a vegan thing to me. Vegans are anti cruelty, isn't it a little cruel for a vegan to wish a species to extinction because of them being carnivores? It's like born being gay, you can't control it, you can't change it.

Edit: I'd like to add that carnivores add balance in ecosystems. Without carnivores herbivores over populate with nothing to kill and eat them. Without carnivores the herbivores are going to overpopulate and humans would need to kill them anyway to keep the population down. Isn't it better to let nature have this balance?",2020-07-20 10:53:03,2,relationship_advice,Trojannx,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

Also, I dont know if you want to be the one to break it to your girlfriend, but to even grow vegan ingredients like soy etc. kills SO many animals. To grow vegan crops, you have to kill so many animals and then a lot of them are organic and pesticide-free which means killing even more animals to keep them away from crops without using pesticides.

Im not one to go on these posts in this absurd subreddit and say ""duuuude just say fuck this person"" cause to be honest, thats the advice most of the immature people on this subreddit give.

"Just from this I'm maybe thinking she either doesnt a tually care about animals as much as she says she does or she has done sone impressive mental gymnastics to get to her current mind set. 

As a vegan whos has pets I completely understand that certain animals, like cats, are obligate carnivores. They NEED meat. 100%. Vegan catfood would do a lot of harm.

Also, I cant say for other vegan but I also understand that animals hunting is vastly different to people farming and slaughtering animals. Hunting is a part of some animals and I don't believe you can claim to care about animals rights if you dont also believe in the rights of predators. 

Now about the cat specifically. If you were to give poor Mittens up, whos to say what life she would have in a shelter or with someone else. At least with you, you're certain shes happy and being looked after.

IMHO op, this is a major red flag. She waited until you two were serious to drop to ultimatum and I wouldn't be surprised if theres more to be dropped if you start living together.

Nah at that point she’s advocating death of an animal and she’s far worse than the meat eating people and species she’s dislikes so much. Most meat eaters don’t want entire species to be killed.

I am glad you are keeping mittens.  As i read your post my mind was screaming control.  Why should you remove something that makes you happy in your life?  There is something more to her story about mittens. She knows that cats eat meat.  Is she jealous of the affection you give Mittens?  At least you found out at this stage of your relationship.  She had issues and Mittens is being used as an excuse.

I would strongly encourage you to research cat diets. catinfo.org is a really good place to start.

I understand where you are coming from as I am vegan myself, but removing meat from a cat's diet will kill them eventually and cause a lot of health issues.

"You're not going crazy. And the problem here is not your GF's ideology. It is ok for her to not eat animals. It is ok for her to limit her human relationships to people who also don't eat animals. 

But she can't apply her ideology to your cat. 

The problem here is that your GF is a zealot and believes anything that doesn't eat like her should die. So if domestic cats should be exterminated because they eat meat, should humans who eat meat also be exterminated? Either this unbending zealotry is a ruse to break up, or it is a demonstration of her unwillingness to compromise on things that are important to her partner in a relationship. But either way...you can't have a relationship with someone who can't compromise with you. And you can't have a relationship with a zealot unless you believe exactly everything exactly the way they do.

So please don't think you are the crazy one here. Compromise is inherent in relationships of any sort. That she's starting out this way, by making unreasonable demands without any attempts to talk it through and attempt to come  to a solution with you, is a very bad sign. If it wasn't the cat it would be something else eventually. 

Worse is now she has chosen  doubling down by trying to guilt and shame you with that reddit link. She's not trying to dialogue with you. She's trying to forcibly convert you to her way of thinking through manipulation.

"When you date an extremist of any kind, you're dating a person whose extremist view is, by default, more important than the concept of a relationship. Sooner or later this will go badly for the other person in the relationship. The relationship-view is about *relation*, which is give and take with another, compromise, settling, cooperation, in order to build a unit that is better than the two of you individually. Both of you have to participate. It's not a leader-follower thing.

When you're young and starting out, losing a person after seven months seems devastating. That's because you're not old enough to know what a long-term relationship actually is or what it involves...or what can and will happen. You'll know when you've spent at least five years as an adult outside your parents' houses with the person. Ten will start to give you a real idea. If this sounds terrifying or weird or whatever with Vegan GF, that's fine. It's a sign that this is not a long-term or even medium-term relationship.

Part of any relationship is the community around you--friends, family, other people. As a middle-aged man who is required to put up with very, very little crap, I wouldn't tolerate having her around for more than ten minutes. If you have any relatives who fit my description, or even friends, let me assure you they feel the same way, even if they are too polite or concerned for you to tell you. Over time, this is the kind of headwind that just isn't worth it if you're actually trying for a serious, long-term commitment. Sucks, and you're probably shaking your head No! right now, but it's true. It's also something you don't need to find out the hard way, unlike some of life's lessons. Your parents don't need to *like* your partner, although they probably will if you're doing it right. They need to take her seriously as an adult. (That's a Huge Life Secret, btw.)

There are so. many. women. out there for you. SO MANY. Meet some of them. 

But really it comes down to this: you have a cat whom you love, named MITTENS ffs, and she cares more about her extremist view than something you care about very much.

"As a vegan, I would like to say that your girlfriend is full of shit. First she was apprehensive because she ""didn't grow up with cats"" and now the cat suddenly has to go for different reasons? She is using the vegan argument to manipulate you into getting rid of your cat because she just doesn't like her.

We as humans have created the problem of domesticated animals. Dogs and cats can't survive without us and that's our fault. There are two options. 1) All pets are sterilized and fed their appropriate diet until all of them have died out. 2) Euthanasia on a massive scale to get rid of all of them. Is she going to help kill off the millions of domesticated animals on earth?

I have a dog who is hyper allergic and can only eat a raw natural diet. I don't like having to buy meat for her - but it is what it is. She needs it to survive - I don't. I'm not feeding her an unhealthy diet to make myself feel better. I only adopt death row dogs from shelters and I discourage breeding - that way I am at least part of the solution and not the problem.

DO NOT PUT YOUR CAT ON A ""VEGAN"" DIET. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they have to eat a pure meat diet to stay alive. Dogs can have some omni elements in their diet, cats can't. At all.

For the love of god, don't give your cat away. Your girlfriend sounds pretty controlling and manipulative. If things don't work out because of this it isn't just because she doesn't like your cat. It's because of a deeper underlying issue that surfaces in the form of this cat argument. She should respect your choices and boundaries and she should be happy about something that gives you so much joy - she shouldn't force you to give it up.",2020-07-20 12:18:25,2,relationship_advice,dead_PROcrastinator,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"There is no such thing as vegan cat food, cats are obligate carnivores. And listen, I respect people who want to live a cruelty free life, but she seems to be taking it to where it's falling into mental illness/compulsion if she's denying nature it's due (i.e. cats eating meat). Also cats are only semi domesticated and if you have a happy cat, where you provide it a safe life and care then that in itself is not cruel. Nature is hardcore brutal, and there's no working around that. If you did house mittens he'd most likely be dead. If she's not willing to listen to reason and your whole life is going to be limited to what she finds acceptable or unacceptable you may need to rethink why you're with her. It sounds like her choices come from a reaction, maybe to trauma, than logic.

As an aside, nothing is truly cruelty free, it's just some of the cruelty is more obvious. Farms displace wildlife (cruel), deplete soil (cruel), and kill pests (including intruding animals) and when harvesting kill hundreds of thousands of small animals on the ground of the fields. But the product delivered is a plant and not meat so it's considered cruelty free. The inevitable conclusion of cruelty free is where humans do not exist to cause harm. Which leaves nature to go back to it's murderous brutal self.",2020-07-20 12:27:00,2,relationship_advice,jewishcaveman,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

That being said, OP, your partner is going too far with veganism. If she has a problem with outdoor cats and wildlife that's one thing, but the way this is written makes it sounds like she would rid the world of all carnivores if she had the power.

My parents taught me that owning an animal is some serious shit. You have been given control of a life and you never ever betray that.

"As you say, you weren't vegan at the time you adopted Mittens, and if you had been you might not have got a cat. But you did adopt Mittens, and in doing so you made a commitment to take care of them and protect them. Adopting a pet is like adopting a child: they are part of your family now. Your gf is being unreasonable. (Also, giving Mittens away will not reduce the amount of meat being eaten in the world, and I'm sure your gf wouldn't be keen on the idea of having Mittens put down. So giving Mittens up isn't really achieving anything.) 
I would suggest talking to your gf when you've both calmed down, laying out that you have a duty of care to Mittens that you're not willing to violate, and pointing out that her request doesn't reduce the amount of animal suffering in the world. The one compromise that I can think of is that you commit to not adopting any cats in the future once Mittens passes away.

"So, I’m not vegan. I get the cause, and I buy vegan and cruelty-free beauty/cleaning products, but giving up meat as a food is just not in the cards for me. Don’t get me wrong, I love animals, but yeah. Just thought I should be straight up about that before giving my advice.

Your girlfriend is... wrong? For lack of a better word? I’m not sure how to explain this super well, but I’ll try: a lot of vegans (not most, I’m aware it’s only a vocal minority) try to push this line of thinking that carnivorous animals are inherently bad. Life could not sustain itself without carnivores, they’re necessary. She’s being pulled in by the more extreme side of veganism, which happens to people. I’ve had friends go in and back out of that. I think talking to her about the need for carnivores in nature might help? Along with that, perhaps your could talk to her about feeding your cat food from companies that are humane (not sure how well she’ll take it, but it’s what my husband and I do).

Also, I agree with the people here saying this is a control issue. I doubt it will stop with your cat. She should understand the bond you have with Mittens and be respectful of that. Will she want you to end friendships over veganism? Ties with family members? That’s something you should discuss with her.

"It's ones choice to eat in a certain manner. As humans we have this choice. We may choose to eat one way because it's cheap, it help lose weight, it helps our health, or we feel a certain way about the entire food processing industry. 

I respect those who make whatever voice, even though that may not align with my own.

But is she expecting the cat to make this choice/sacrifice as well? Can cats even eat in a vegetarian/vegan manner?

I would not give an animal for anyone (unless it was unhappy for some reasons within my household, which it seems Mittens is).  You love Mittens. I'm sure you guys are wonderful companions. You take care of her. You aren't harming her in any way. Does your girlfriend think it would be better for you to give Mittens away, possibly to an unfit family and her be harmed, than for her to be loved and cared for in your care. Wouldn't that truly be animal cruelty?

I think if you do this, it will be a slippery slope of requests from her.  In a relationship compromise must go both ways. You adjusted to her way of eating...without question.

"I had kinda thought that veganism was about removing yourself from the wasteful chain of mass production foods and all the harm that comes to animals through that, not just plain Sanctity of Flesh. The cat eats what he needs, and eats what he knows, Mittens isn't building mouse farms and keeping them in cages. Nor is he taking vast amounts of land for agriculture etc etc etc. This whole thing sounds really dumb honestly, what does your gf think happens? Can she bring herself to watch nature documentaries? Those damn moviemakers are making money off the evil animals killing each other! 

I know it would suck for the relationship to end, but you know I also think that a difference in idealogy is a solid reason to end one. All that aside, OP I think you should consider the value of things in your life - you obviously love your cat, does your GF not see that? If she does and still pushes getting rid of the cat, then I'd abort abort and get out of there because in that case she would clearly care more about her damned ideas than you and the other people in her life. If she doesn't see it, I would actually lean toward saying that she hasn't considered your feelings in this at all. Scenario 2 there is potentially redeemable since maybe you can help by showing her the flaws in her world view and talking it out - know that this would be a long path because it is hard, persistent, incremental work that changes people, and in my opinion I think you should spend your time working on yourself in that regard, to build your own view of the world that includes everyone and cares for everything. Maybe you'll hold onto veganism, or maybe you just picked it up because she asked and it made you happy to make her happy. Mittens makes you happy too, just from unconditional love. 

That feels like a long ramble to me, but to look back it seems that she has some flaws in her thinking regarding both veganism and in how a relationship should work. You're going to make your decisions, and whatever happens will be fine. But I think you owe it to Mittens to stand by your pal and companion, because in my opinion that's more important than any ideology.",2020-07-20 11:44:51,1,relationship_advice,patropolis55,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

Your cat will be by your side for 20ish years to come.  You could start cooking meth out of your apartment and mittens will still snuggle up to you every night.

"As a vegan, I would say this is incorrect. To put an animal up for adoption when you can clearly look after it and have already prior to being vegan, would be unethical. Especially when a lot of animals that go to shelters if overpopulated will be euthanised. Additionally, she never asked you to rehome the cat while it was living with you (which I would presume one would if this is supposed against your beliefs), so it seems like this is more control/dislike of having a cat then a vegan issue.

So either she is suggesting that the animal should be killed for existing in her non vegan way or that it’s unfashionable to own it because it isn’t vegan. While it is correct that outdoor cats are terrible for native species and cats should never be allowed to roam outdoors, I just think your GF seems a bit controlling of you and maybe 5 years down the line won’t be the best person to be with.

it sounds to me that she has an issue with cats and she's using veganism as an excuse because saying that she hates cats would clash with her ""animal compassion"" narrative. she's a closeted cat hater. I will never understand cat haters. 

she had no business even making u change your diet, that's the first red flag. is she gonna keep changing the stuff she doesn't agree with or like in u? that's not love, nor healthy. what's next? cause she wasn't honest the first time around and kept this from u, which sounds like a strategy to me. 

my husband is vegetarian and I'm (mostly) pescetarian (allergic to soy and some plant-based proteins). we both do our best to consume cruelty free stuff (living with extreme weather doesn't make it easy) but we adjust to each other's diet restrictions respectfully (we cook stuff we both can eat and separately add whatever on the side for each), we make compromises even when we don't agree. I don't love everything about my husband, but I fell for him just the way he is, asking him to be different than who he is is disrespectful and harmful. and it goes the other way around.

she doesn't love u for u, she wants u to fit into her mold of what her ideal partner is and that's just wrong. I'm sorry she doesn't appreciate u fully for who u are, u deserve better. your cat brings u joy and love and happiness, nobody should ever ask a person they supposedly love to give that up.

This ignores the emotional connection you have with your cat of course. It's the same as saying, ""don't have kids as the earth is over populated"".  Technically right, but ignores the wider issues.

You think that this is a beautiful relationship but that’s how narcissistic people operate, that’s how they draw you in.

"This may not be the best advice here rather what I would do personally still.

I would ask her why she believes having a cat is unconscionable with veganisim and ask follow ups to try and establish her personal philosophy on veganisim and who it's come together. 

Not all veganisim is the same but if she is not able to provide a reasonable discussion that comes from factual and reasonably logical places then in my opinion it's not about veganisim it is something else. 

Communication while difficult is a key part of any relationship, and if you want a long term relationship with anyone you will have to develop these skills because there will always be bad times, and things to work through.

So occasionally I would buy him those soup bones which are meaty animal bones. I'd freeze them and my dog would go crazy for them. 

Being vegan means you care about animals and advocate for their rights. NOT forcing veganism down every living creatures throat. Also it should be a huge red flag to you that she forced you to go from pescatarian to vegan. When I met my current s.o he was a full meat eater and I was fine with that. It's not my job to force someone to change.

"I can understand wanting your potential partner to not eat meat, but dude, a cat? Human people have an option to be all cruelty free and find plant based alternatives if they so choose, but it is totally fucked to try to force that on an animal— it’s just nature. They have dietary needs and that is super unfair to force that on an animal for no reason other than your personal choice. 

Is the next campaign in extreme veganism going out into the safari and wiggling a stick of celery in front of a lion and going “bad kitty no kill! Bad! Have tasty celery and PB instead”?? It just doesn’t make sense.

*Anywho*; absolutely if the cat was such an issue that conflicted her “morals” so extremely she should have been upfront about it and not tried to cover it up with the whole “oh I didn’t grow up around cats”. She chose to let your relationship progress first and *then* dropped that on you after having you invest time and emotional connection— 100% manipulative. 
Def try to bring that up to her; why were you not clear on that in the beginning, that is pretty messed up. 

And do not compromise! For her to ask that and just completely not be considerate of the fact that cat is more than just a meat eater that lives in your home, it’s a companion and a friend and a confidante. Especially after having her for so long. I’ve had my cat Annie for about 2 weeks and I already can’t imagine waking up and not seeing her all snuggled up at my toes on the foot of the bed. 

Mittens doesn’t deserve to be rehomed bc some extreme vegan gal came into the picture and lied about her feelings until she got you invested. It’s not what you want to hear, but if she can’t be convinced that 

A. That was fucked up for her to cover that up and

B. You can’t just get rid of Mittens, she’s more than a carnivore and she’s been around way longer than you

I know many vegans who were okay with dating people who aren't vegan, and I understand that it would be easier if you were like her but...now she's forcing her thoughts on your *cat* too. This is basically taking it to a whole new level. She is ruining the food web. Also, there are drawbacks to being vegan anyways and many people have went back to eating meat at some point of their lives. Simply because humans are made to eat meat, and you're not ""killing"" animals. This is a food web where energy is transferred. We die one day and become one with the soil and plants use that for photosynthesis. Would you call out a freaking plant for eating humans then? Living organisms live in an ecosystem that needs to be balanced. One of the factors of balancing it is by keeping the food web untouched. It's not a sin to eat salmon if you love it.

So how do you get a reputation like that except if you're making it a part of your identity and talk about it with everyone around you. That's kind of a red flag already.

You also state that having a pet can be controversial in vegan spaces. It's not. Only extremists who see veganism as their entire identity make this a problem. Most vegans do not think this. 

It looks to me that your ex really tried to change you over the course of your relationship. And she succeeded to an extent until she made a batshit insane demand from you.

"In all reality, from what you have said, she is uncomfortable around the cat. So the getting rid of it is more about that than anything else. Now the real question is, is she controlling in other ways? Can y'all sit down and discuss her discomfort and get to the root of the problem? If not and if she is controlling or close minded, then your future together isn't bright anyway. But if she will sit and talk and admit her discomfort is the root of it, then see if you can put your cat with a good friend or family you can trust to take good care of it and let you see it some. Unless your cat means more than your girlfriend. In that case your girlfriend wouldn't have a good future with you anyway

"So healthy relationships are built on trust that grows over time when people find mutual ground on things and communicate. You were willing to compromise for her and change your diet and probably a laundry list of other things, but the thought of living with you is only possible if you give up your furry companion whom has millions of years of evolution to become the efficient carnivore that it is?  

The cat is the barrier in this entire situation? So much so that you actually considered feeding the cat a vegan diet of which it simply had never evolved to digest?  Does the cat actually have GI issues or were you attempting to feed it a diet that would be kosher for the girlfriend, because spoiler alert it's not a cow.

This cat saved you and you're not even aware.  Can you imagine living with someone and never being able to have an opinion of your own or do anything you wanted to because it's not on the list pre-approved things given to you by an outside party all in the name of ""love"".  It's all cute and lovely when it's new, fresh and exciting and you have the blinders on.... But once theyre off, that level of control is borderline abusive at best.

You're an omnivore and that trait was passed down by your ancestors because during the bare winter months starving to death didn't sound that appealing.  Now we live in a time where you are afforded the luxury to choose what and how much you consume because of where you live.  

I bet if you tell her that you're keeping the cat, she'll tell you she's allergic and probably didn't tell you because she didn't want to hurt your feelings.

Spoiler alert, she's not allergic. She's manipulating you to get what she wants because it didn't work the first time.

"Your girlfriend obviously has some severe holes in her education. The best way to decimate an ecosystem is to remove the apex predators? Life is about balance. Mice and rat populations have been controlled in urban settings for centuries by domesticated cats. Rats and mice when in overcrowded conditions spread disease and pestilence. During biology at school we were taught a very simple example about the lynx and hare population cycles. link below. basically if the hare (big bunnies) are left unchecked they wipe out their food source causing a crash in population due to starvation and disease. Because the lynx predates on the hare it keeps the population in check and healthy. Maybe try educate her first. If she can't see the problem in her thinking then I am sad to say the problems in the relationship run deeper than just difference in ideology.

"Had to step in on this one. You did the right thing walking away. It's one thing as a human to make the choice not to eat meat, but animals don't understand the same way we do. I mean, would she go to Africa and replace a pack of lions meat with vegetables? No. They'd eat her alive for fucking with their foods.

You can't change the nature of animals, but despite being hunters, doesn't mean they're bad creatures. I love my cats, they're hillarious and adorable. Sure it ain't nice to wake up to a dead mouse on the floor, but that's just how they are. They can't help it and their bodies aren't designed to eat plants.

Edit: I lost my train of thought writing this; cats are obligated carnivors, it's the circle of life. Is you gf also in favor of killing lions because they kill gazelles ? It makes no sense.

"Get rid of the girlfriend and keep the kitty! Seriously, some vegans... I understand the opinion not to eat meat and have a plant-based diet, because as humans we are omnivores, we can eat and be happy with either lifestyle.   
HOWEVER, a cat (or a dog for that matter) has no choice! They're carnivores by design. \*shakes head\*  


Seriously though, I agree with some of the other commentors saying that its not really about the cat, its about seeing how far she can control you. Eventually she would only have you meet with her friends, and you'll find yourself being less of your own person and more of a parrot echoing her thoughts and ideals. Saw that first-hand with my sister. A relationship like that can screw up you and your family and leave you stranded without friends and without any clear idea who you are and what you like.

Quality of life for animals is very important to them and owning pets is about giving them a comfortable life outside of pounds and shelters.

"It isn't really the place of a vegan to lament about animals killing other animals. It occurs in nature and by definition, it's natural. 


But I'll level with your girlfriend on not wanting to support the meat industry by buying pet food.  I also don't eat meat but my pets do. Humans don't need it, we're omnivores and can live healthy without meat in our diets. Dogs are also omnivores but it's difficult for them to be healthy without meat. Cats are [obligatory carnivores](https://www.aspca.org/news/why-cant-my-cat-be-vegan) according to the ASPCA. In the wild, they need meat to survive. It's the nutrients in meat they need, however, not the meat itself.  There are foods like [this](https://becauseanimals.com/blogs/magazine/can-pet-food-be-made-without-animals) that are trying to make those nutrients available from other sources.


So I think you should show those links to your girlfriend and have a conversation about this.  There are compromises to be made here about what sources of food Mittens can eat, but you can't make a wild animal not hunt a mouse in the backyard, that's unnatural. There's also the fact that not feeding Mittens will kill her, which isn't vegan-friendly, and that rehoming her would likely put her in a house where'd she'd consume even more meat.",2020-07-20 10:00:05,1,relationship_advice,humanCPengineer,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"As a vegan myself I do not believe owning a pet is against veganism. 

Actually I think it’s good for veganism. Owning a pet teaches compassion and empathy for animals. And if that’s how people connect to an idea of a cruelty free world then so be it! And while domestic cats can have a negative impact on local ecosystems, the impact is small compared to any of the agricultural and game management in your area. And if your cat is an indoor cat, problem solved.

Also your cat is happy living with you I presume. He/she is fed, enriched and loved. To give her up to a shelter where she would receive little 1-1 time with the humans mittens relies on is cruel to the cat, and any other animal who is prevented from that emergency care that actually needs it. And if your partner knows anything about the workings of animals shelters, she will know what would happen if mittens doesn’t get re-homed. 

It sounds like your GF has gotten veganism wrong on this occasion. Perhaps prepare a concise and logical counter argument. And explain that the cat came before veganism and shouldn’t be punished for your life choices. Which is, in fact, the whole point of veganism.

"Yeah no.. Even if it wasn't a veganism issue it would still be a no. Pets are family members. You don't just give up a family member because your partner doesn't like them. I'm obsessed with dogs and feel like I can't properly function if I don't have one in my life but my boyfriend would happily never have one in his life. When we first moved in he made my life hell with complaints over the dog. I made it clear that he either makes the best of the situation or he's out of the picture nor my dog. Bear in mind I moved countries for this guy so we are absolutely serious about our relationship.

Also the natural food chain means that some animals eat other animals. There's even carnivorous plants. Only we as humans with a conscience and logical brain can choose to give up/make lifestyle decisions like eating some foods and avoiding others. Only because we have other options for food and because we see the harm perpetrated by us towards other animals in mass farming, etc. So your cat isn't being ""cruel""..

I don't think you should back off as it doesn't make any sense to give up the cat. You already have him and unless you kill him, he will be eating meat no matter what.

I'm usually cringing at how fast people here jump on the break up train, but this is probably one of those.

Your gf is completely unreasonable. Not to mention she is unhealthily obsessed with veganism to the point that she depends on the ideology to have an identity and disregards anything else. Her argument about a natural carnivore animal eating meat and even mice (!) is like a wall to me. There's literally nothing you can say to a person with such little ability for critical thinking. And the vegan sub is extremely toxic imo, it's impossible to have a mature conversation if you are not 100% agreeing with them.

If I had to judge based on the little info I have about her, I wouldn't see her coming to her senses. 

Maybe you could try having a talk with her along with other vegans who agree with you?

"I know there's a running joke about /r/relationship_advice saying to break up, but it doesn't sound reconsilable from here to me personally, but I don't know your GF. 

While it's true, [the over abundance of cats does damage many ecosystems](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380), that doesn't mean domestic cats don't have the right to eat and live. A lot of cats can be fussy about their food, a vegan diet for a naturally carnivorous animal isn't going to help that at all. Also, giving her to a different owner isn't going to reduce the amount of meat Mittens eats throughout her life, and as a non-sapient carnivore, your cat doesn't have the luxury of choice like humans do. If your girlfriend has thought this much through at all, I have to believe it's not about veganism or the cat, but about making you do this for her. Now for the other point... **Advocating for the extinction of a species is possibly the** ***least*** **vegan thing I have ever heard.** 

This stance of making cats extinct is *dangerously misinformed* at the absolute best and beyond malicious at worst. Seriously, this is a huge deal breaker for most people.

In fact it would really help me, and I'd appreciate it, if you could just listen while I get this off my chest, and \**if you could listen to hear, not to rebut.* I want to know everything you're thinking and feeling once I'm done.

I don't think it's a choice I can make and I'm really hopeful there is another solution. I did some research and....""
* tastefully, respectfully, lay out your points (it'd be distressing to relocate him for myself and mittens / he'd continue to eat meat - maybe less ethically sourced meat - with another owner, etc. etc.).
* **Show you are willing to compromise and ask her for her thoughts:** ""Is there anything else we can do that might work? For instance, in the future, if Mittens passes away I won't get another pet/ can we do some regular volunteering to balance our mojo of owning a cat / I'm wiling to do a tonne of research to find exceptionally ethically sourced food / etc. Thank you for listening, I care so much about you, I really want this to work.

"How the fuck.......okay so, you are a human who makes choices, you choose to be a vegan.

I get that.

You are mad at cats because they eat meat?

That’s absolutely fucking bonkers.   I guess I can kinda see how she doesn’t want you attached to that - but - you’ve had the cat for a long time.   You’re just supposed to throw away a member of your family over this?   That’s like her thinking both you and the cat have no feelings towards each other.   I see absolutely nothing wrong with you being vegan, and you feeding a cat meat.   A cat needs meat.   And there’s absolutely no reason she couldn’t simply be okay with the cat, and pet the little kitty, so long as you weren’t going to get ANOTHER kitty.  

She’s crazy, she’s selfish, she’s controlling, and I’m glad you didn’t give your pussy up for her.   Your pussy is sacred.  She doesn’t deserve you OR that pussy.  

I would be infuriated at a girl if she tried to pull this on me.   I would then tell her that her actions caused me to rethink my stance, and that from now on I will eat as much meat as I possibly can, and give meat to others as often as possible - to minimalist her contribution as a vegan.   No amount of veganing she does will be able to match the swath of death and sizzling meats I leave in my wake.  And it’s happening over a CAT because YOU ARE CRAZY, GIRL.

"I'm sorry, but I'm vegan and the fact that she WANTS you to make an animal homeless, really pisses me off. The only one who needs to be dumped is her. I've never ever known a vegan, who is in it for the animals, to actively want an animal to end up homeless. Cats also kill to survive, thats like trying to ban a lion from hunting and catching prey. They NEED to do it, domesticated or not, it's vital for their survival but also to allow them to show their natural behaviours.

I also despise vegans who think you can just deprive carnivores of meat. If a human doesn't want to eat animals, fine, you have the mental capacity to do that and to provide the correct nutrients in your diet other ways. However, cats simply cannot survive without meat, taurine being one of the most vital things in their diet, making meat vital to their survival.

I genuinely can't believe what I've read, saying she's vegan yet being happy to deprive a carnivore of vital food and allowing said animal to be homeless all whilst crying about them showing natural behaviours. I don't think she genuinely cares at all, its more for attention. No vegan would actively do what she wants, i honestly think you not only deserve better, but your cat deserves better. I have strong beliefs when it comes to animals, yet I would never force an animal into living with the consequences of my beliefs.

I studied Animal Management in college and shit like this gets me, I've seen the consequences of taking away vital food from animals on far too many occasions and it often ends in death. Please, for the sake of your beautiful cat, leave that woman, she cares about herself, not animals and her demands are showing that.

I get that her principles are important to her as well, but as a vet student, animals will be animals, if anything, we're the ones messing with their life and naturally cats are carnivores. Period. They seriously wont do well with a vegan diet. She should understand that, it's basically animal cruelty if you won't let an animal act like how it usually is in the wild.

"you need to put your foot down, she thinks she can control you. you already went vegan for her. 

even if you would give up your cat, your relationship would become a shitfest where she thinks she can have anything she wants because you are too needy to end it. then she will lose even more attraction and abuse you until theres nothing left to gain for her and then dump you.

your best option is to tell her assertively that you will not tolerate that kind of irrational behavior in your relationship and that if she is not ok with you having a cat then she can fuck right off and you should move on. dont try to convince her, dont beg, just leave after you made your point clear, and ignore her texts and calls for as long as she is trying to bait you into this idea.

she will either not pursue you, that means good riddance, she didnt like you that much anyway/ it wasnt meant to be, or she will do a full 180 and not want to lose you and you will be able to be in control and guide the relationship towards a direction that you see fit.

"Perhaps you can explain to her the whole basis for veganism; to care for creatures.

Cats are domesticated. Sure, they can live outside, but it’s extremely harmful for local wildlife. Letting a cat live wild is extremely harmful to local populations. 
Meanwhile, cats eating mice is as inevitable as eagles eating fish; it’s completely natural and falls into the natural cycle. 
Another reason to go vegan is to reduce a carbon footprint. Having a cat isn’t going to increase this all.

The only argument for getting rid of a cat is an EXTREMELY arbitrary “I don’t eat meat” without thinking of the reason why you don’t eat meat.

That being said, for me, pets are family. There is no way in hell I’d give up an old relationship with my pet for a new relationship for a person.",2020-07-20 10:51:39,1,relationship_advice,Jermermer,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"Count me as another vegan who thinks your girlfriend has lost her fucking mind.

I actually get told similar stuff on a semi-regular basis; I have cats and I get a lot of people trying to ""checkmate"" my veganism by pointing out that a real vegan wouldn't have flesh-eating animals. Yes, like not rescuing these cats and letting them die abandoned on the street would be the more vegan choice I suppose? It's usually meat-eaters that say this to me, and in my opinion they're not policing my behaviour because they care deeply about moral consistency, but because they're looking to exert power/control by putting me in what they believe to be an uncomfortable situation.

Reverse the vegan/meat-eater roles and I think that's exactly the same thing your girlfriend is doing. Getting rid of the cat is her way of exerting control over you and the relationship. Her veganism is a handy excuse.

"She’s insane. I’ve been vegan for a while now and am pretty outspoken for animal rights but still own a dog, who eats meat. He’s a carnivore, it’s necessary for him to eat meat to be healthy, and it’s even more necessary for cats to, as they are obligate carnivores. 

I don’t understand what she will get from this though, if you send the cat to a shelter or another owner, she will still continue to eat meat, but will also likely be frightened by the transition to another environment. The net result is negative, and in fact there are no positives. 
Breeding cats and buying kittens is another issue, but actively getting rid of animals that are already here is a misunderstanding of veganism.

She’s using veganism as an excuse to act in a controlling manner so that she can claim she has the ethical high ground while neglecting your opinion. It’s like when people say ‘it’s me or the video games’ they don’t have a problem with the video games, they have a problem with the fact they don’t have full control over another person. 

Perhaps try to have a conversation with her where you compromise, so maybe mittens stays downstairs (although I know cats love to go everywhere so that’s up to your discretion).

Honestly if I was in a position where my partner said I had to leave my dog I would be out of that relationship faster than they’d finished the sentence.",2020-07-20 11:01:33,1,relationship_advice,Beantap,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"I’m not so sure it’s about the cat either. It actually sounds like she’s just wanting to control you. She wanted you to change your diet. She wants you to give up your cat. I’m guessing there’s other things not mentioned that she’s had you change.

She is trying to change you into what she wants you to be, she doesn’t actually like the man who eats fish and has a cat. She wants to manipulate him into being who she wants (but she probably won’t like you after you’ve changed either). You are right, if the cat was a dealbreaker she should have said so in the first week of dating. She didn’t because she thought she could manipulate you into getting rid of the cat. She probably started out with other things, smaller things she manipulated you into changing before moving on to the cat. 

Normally I would always recommend counseling. In this case, either give up everything you value and change everything about yourself to try to make her happy, and know when that fails to make her happy you’ll get sick of it and leave or she’ll leave you. Or just leave now and save yourself the heartache.

"That's absolutely absurd! Cats need to eat meat or they become extremely poorly and malnourished.

Yes, I get her opinion on predation, and I agree cats should be kept indoors (with the right stimulants to ensure their welfare). I don't know if there's a way to dampen her hatred for domesticated animals, but perhaps digging around Reddit and other platforms for sources on why starving carnivores with vegan diets (such as the poor fennec fox which was heavily circulated a few years ago) may open her eyes to her ignorance a little.

"What about predators like wolves, lions, and bears? They eat meat. Should they be extinct too because of it? Unfortunately for your girlfriend's idealistic world views, the ecosystem relies on plants, herbivores, and carnivores to function. Whether domestic house cats fit into that is neither here nor there at this point. Cats exist and they need loving homes. That is what you are providing for Mittens. 

Your girlfriend doesn't seem to think rationally about this. This is not a reasonable view to have--that cats are inherently bad creatures because of what they eat. And to that end, there's no guarantee of a ""cruelty-free"" diet, anyway. Wildlife is killed and displaced to make room for crops. Farms use traps and poisons to prevent different animals from destroying crops. If her home had a mouse/rat infestation, she'd likely want an exterminator to fix the problem. My point isn't anything against the vegan lifestyle. Just that vegans *like her* need to be realistic and understand every way of life has negative implications for animals. She doesn't get to claim some moral high ground because, like it or not, whether she chooses to or not, her existence means that her life has taken priority--and continues to take priority--over numerous animals. It's commendable that she wants to minimize it in every way she can, but she can never erase it.

Second, I know LOTS of vegans who have cats. Meat eatting cats.
And lastly I think this is something serious to think about as a relationship aspect. Shes asking you to give up something you love because it eats meat. Where does that line stop? Do you have friends who eat meat? Is that going to be a problem? What about family? 
What if this is how it is with everything she doesnt like? You give it up or it's over.
I'm sorry this is happening, but demands like this are never good. This is where her control begins, and that's what she wants.",2020-07-20 10:48:01,1,relationship_advice,ChurtchPidgeon,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
She asked you to change your lifestyle to a cruelty free one in order to be with her. You complied. Now she wants you to give up your cat?  What’s next?

"Keep the cat and dump the girl. I love my bf, but if he told me to get rid of my cats, he’s for the streets and I’ll snuggle my fur babies extra hard. No, your gf (who should be an ex) is fucking insane and a disgusting zealot who doesn’t care about animals at all. Any sane vegetarian and vegan knows that cats are carnivores because that’s the natural law. Would you feed a tiger bloody vegetables? Of course not. You’ll feed the tiger heaping bleeding masses of animal flesh because that’s its natural diet. Animals don’t get the luxury of choosing what to eat. 

They are either born predator or prey. Veganism is supposed to protect animals from human consumption, not to protect animals from animal consumption. I find it sickening when crazy vegans purposefully buy predatory animals and try to force them to eat a plant based diet because of their personal beliefs. Animals don’t have personal beliefs, only their instincts as prey or predator to survive. 

You’ll regret giving up your cat. You can find another girl, but you’ll never find another Mittens. You’ve already said your gf is being uncompromising and stubborn to the point you literally have to hang out with her at her place just so that Mittens and her don’t cross paths. That alone should’ve been a huge red flag. In my eyes, if someone doesn’t like my animals at all, they’re not good for me. My bf met my cats for the first time a couple of weeks ago and loved them up so he’s good in my books. 

If a person truly loved or liked you, they would never put you in a situation like this. Your gf is trying to control you to the max. She already succeeded in controlling your diet and attitude towards food. She’s trying to systematically trying to eliminate what doesn’t fit in her ideal world. She knew you were a cat owner yet still chose to be with you. 

Your gf thinks now that she converted you into veganism, she can start pushing her heavier agenda on you by first trying to have you eliminate your cat and in her mind, have you support her agenda in supporting the extermination of domesticated cats and then the next phases she prepared. She’s a sociopath and pre-planned this. This isn’t a coincidence or all of a sudden. Your gf is trying to mold you into her ideal kind of partner and attempting to push out your “old” tendencies and attributes, and replacing them with her tendencies and attributes under your name. Next thing you know, you can’t be friends with non vegans or see your non vegan family members. 

This relationship isn’t about love or trying to make yourself a better you for your benefit. To her, this relationship is about control and attempting to mold you into her ideal man with beliefs and ideals you don’t even believe for yourself. You need to get rid of her before she gains more control over your life. Mittens is your child and your child needs you more than your gf needs you.

"As a vegan, this is ridiculous. She is being completely unreasonable and clearly doesn't understand the real point of veganism. Animal instinct is irrelevant as it's in their nature.

Also, if you care about animals, you should much prefer a cat to have a loving home than be in a shelter. She's either delusional or just making excuses for something else.

Third, apparently you are the one who keeps making compromises. You ain't a boyfriend, you are a pet and she has fun / satisfaction telling you what to do, else she wouldn't be doing it.

"Well the cat will still eat meat even if u give it up. That is, of course unless you put it down which kinda defeats the purpose since thats cruel tu the cat at tu yourself.

Its deeply unfair to apply the same judgment we have for people to cats. The biggest problem is that people can be vegan, we have the option of avoiding slaughtering animals and yet we chose to still eat meat. Cats are cats, theyre strictly carnivoure.

The point about the cat hunting just doesnt make sense. Unless your home is full of rats I imagine the cat doesnt really have an opportunity to hurt any mice. If ur cat was in a shelter or on the street the possibiloty of it hurting other animals is greatly increased.

"People break up all the time due to incompatability and that's fine. She told you that her code of ethics cannot accommodate owning a pet, so if she's not comfortable with it and it's a deal-breaker for you, sounds like the relationship is over.

It seems like a lot of the comments are about how he shouldn't feed his pet a vegan diet, but the gf never suggested that. (And yes, I do think cats should be fed a meat-based diet.) Or about how vegans want Peta to kill all the pets? These appear to be false flag arguments included for the purpose of virtue-signalling, since they have nothing to do with OP's situation? I think these commenters mean well and are trying to be supportive, but they're reading too much into the story by adding details that aren't relevant.

I don't think that she's necessarily doing it simply to try to control him. From what OP said, it seems like it's something she deeply believes in. If they are in it long-term, that cat becomes *their* cat and that isn't a tenable ethical position for her.

Not saying whether it's wrong or right, but I think it's a bit unfair to verbally crucify the gf, calling her crazy, etc.

Shouldn't we give people the benefit of the doubt with their intentions and try to empathize even when it's difficult to understand someone's perspective?

Additionally, I don't think it's about ""misrepresenting veganism,"" because it's simply her personal take on what it means to live ethically, which often involves sacrifice and hard decisions.

That being said, veganism certainly doesn't need any more ""bad press"" as people vehemently *hate* the vegan community in general. A lot of the comments feel a bit too gleeful with the vegan-bashing. It's one thing not to agree with her ideas, but not wanting a cat doesn't in and of itself make a person a monster. I can definitely see it from her point of view: she might have advocated against people keeping pets, maybe this is an oft-repeated and well-known stance of hers, it's something she firmly believes, with a conviction not unlike a deeply-held religious belief, something sacred to her. People love to praise religious beliefs as being sacrosanct and inviolable, but other moral systems such as secular humanism, veganism, feminism, etc. are treated as whims. People's beliefs are important to them, regardless of whether they're based in religious dogma or modern rational ethics.

Once again, I'm not saying that she's right or that you should give up your cat.

Follow your heart and do what feels right, which, based on your post, seems like ending things with her.

I hope that she is sympathetic, understanding of your decision and mature about the break-up. Best of luck!",2020-07-20 10:40:01,1,relationship_advice,The_Jedi_UR_Looking4,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"Having come from a failed marriage in which my partner did not want pets even though I loved my dogs and always wanted to have a cat I caution you strongly to consider the reasons why your GF wishes to control such personal aspects of your life. Pets are a healthy part of one's life and bring joy to those who are lucky enough to own them. I presently have two fantastic kitties who have brought me much joy. 

Your GF's reason for not wanting to associate with cats is ridiculous. I think there is some other underlying reason for her dislike of cats and yours especially. Is there a jealousy issue? Is your love for your cat somehow threatening to your GF? 

I don't know you or your GF but I see an underlying pattern of control that mirrors what I went through for 15 years. The only way I could placate my spouse was to adhere to all the rules imposed on me. You are falling into that pattern. You have adopted a lifestyle that pleases your partner, you are expected to dispose of your beloved pet and etc. Having a partner is not a matter of one dictating the behaviors of the other. In an ideal situation, it is give and take with each making accommodations that benefit the relationship. 

I would suggest serious consideration on your part about whether you can live with emotional blackmail and the constant need to change who and what you are to placate another.

Sorry dude, she's insane (and controlling); It's a cat, they eat meat, its what they do: hunt, catch, kill.  If she can't compromise or base-line understand something like a cat, wait until you get a house/mortgage, have kids, be financially responsibly with mutual dependency, and have to make REAL compromises.

 Make her aware that a cruelty-free lifestyle goes beyond ones diet, its about kinship and love.  Mittens and you are bound and it would be very cruel to separate you, and it would be very cruel to change a cats diet from its natural, biochemically-driven carnivorous demands.

"No cruelty means no cruelty at all. If we humans can live without meat, cats can't. It doesn't mean we should exterminate cats.

You know, in biology exams at school they ask a question: what if we take a third link (1 - plants, 2 - herbivorous animals, 3 - predators) from a food chain? Herbivorous animals will reproduce freely and then just die from illnesses and rivalry over food. Killing wolves or cats is not saving hares or mise.

Also, cats don't have ideology, they shouldn't be responsible for human nonsense. By the way, I'm okay if a lion wants to eat me, it's natural, but I'd kill it protecting myself. That's why I don't walk where lions live and don't go there to kill all lions, it's harming the nature in the same way as having so much cattle to feed people that cattle's food can't regenerate.

I know there’s a bunch of comments already but as a vegan she should know house cats are not supposed to be outside or wild. Domesticated cats that get let outside are actually horrible for the environment and give certain animals another predator. Look up how many birds have gone extinct just bc of house cats being let outside. You’re actually helping the environment by keeping her. Also she sounds controlling asf. Red flag from the jump of her trying to change you just to fit her lifestyle. She should love you for u and not your beliefs.

"Pass on her. Not worth your time.

Her defense was that cats eat meat and kill mice?

They are carnivores... They survive by hunting... You can't push your vegan beliefs on animals because you somehow think your morals transcend into the animal kingdom.

Also, it's one thing to ask someone to stop doing hard drugs before moving to the next step of your relationship. Or stop sleeping on their parents couch and think about a career... Or to stop sleeping with other people before the next step.

The cat came before Her, and if she doesn't realize that she isn't going to work out.

Something to think about. If she's willing to call it quits until you get rid of the cat, where does that end?

She'll hold it against you forever.

I'm so so happy you keep your cat instead of that selfish woman. It's definitely not about being cruelty-free - like many others said, Mittens will eat meat no matter where he lives. If anything, it's pure cruelty to separate Mittens from his beloved owner - it's always breaking my heart when I hear about this happening, cats get so attached to their humans and just giving them away to someone else like a piece of furniture is beyond cruel.

Of course it will be hard for a while, and I'm sorry you have to go through this.

"Bro. Just nope. Don't compromise a pet you love for an absolute moron of a girlfriend. You are still so young, she's probably not the one. Especially not if she's this stupid. Humans can be vegan because we're omnivores and we have the technology and knowledge to create a plant based diet for ourselves. Cats are true carnivores and they need meat. Perhaps a vegan alternative is possible, but it's probably stupid expensive and still not that healthy. There's three types of vegans... Those who do it for health, those who do it for ethical reasons, and those who do it based on emotions. Your girlfriend is the third. She is projecting human emotions onto the animal world. This is a hard type of person to deal with. They don't listen to logic, they just convince themselves that whatever they feel is true. Move on. This problem will materialize again in other areas of the relationship. You can find someone who doesn't make ridiculous demands of you.

Edit - Also. The reddit thread supporting the extinction of domesticated house cats????? She's gone down the wrong path. Again, she is projecting her own human emotions onto animals and it's just absurd. This is like supervillain logic. It's twisted.

"Hey there! You can absolutely have a cat and take care of them, it is not against ones vegan values to take care of a cat, which is a carnivore. Veganism is about not participating in their exploitation and cruel deaths. I understand that for vegan pet owners, especially cats, that buying their food can seem morally dubious. But she is going to have to understand that mittens is a member of your family who has specialized needs. As a vegan she should understand that mittens might end of in an abusive home or a shelter. 

You would do well to remind her that mittens is a living being, she's your friend, and that you're not going to get rid of her because her diet doesn't coincide with your new beliefs.

"I’m a vegan and I have three cats. Two pedigree cats that were purchased prior to going vegan and one stray I adopted also prior to going vegan. It would be cruel and unjust for me to take three cats out of their home and put them in a shelter where they may potentially be euthanised just because they consume meat to live. 

I try to mitigate the harm my cats do. I live in Australia so I feed them kangaroo meat, this meat is culled and not farmed so my purchasing does not result in any more animals being killed than if I did not. Depending on your country you could look into similar options. 

Another factor to consider is that cat food is mostly made from cast off bits of other animals. The parts we as humans don’t consume. While this doesn’t erase the damage it does mean that those animals are likely being killed regardless of cat food. It’s not ideal but they need the nutrients in cat food that they can’t get from a purely kangaroo meat diet. 

You had your cat before you went vegan, you seem to be making an effort to feed it as ethically as you can. It would be equally unethical to get rid of Mittens. He would either be euthanised or left in a shelter indefinitely. So either way more animal death.

I could understand your girlfriend not wanting you to get another cat, but frankly her position is far too black and white. Veganism is complex. However, if she won’t budge dump her.

"You’ve only been dating for seven months. You’ll find another person you’re a lot more compatible with. 

The rational response aside, vegans are little mentally unhinged. Their entire philosophy revolves around guilt and constantly superimposing the idea of cannibalism over the regular intake of other forms of matter. 

In my youth, my favorite activity was to remind vegans that plants are just as ‘alive’ as the more complex organisms with ‘eyes that you can look into before you kill.’ Frankly, it’s quite hypocritical to go on and on about how you shouldn’t eat other forms of life because what if it was YOUR form of life, when you’re just going about continue to sustain yourself with ‘lesser’ forms of life. 

Living matter, at our level of complexity, consumes other forms of living matter, regardless of how they obtain their energy from their environment or perceive they’re environment. It is extremely irrational and arbitrarily to focus on a narrow band on living matter and say ‘hands off’. 

No, I’m not arguing for cannibalism - slow your roll.

"This is about her next step in controlling you, a d taking over decisions in your life. She's a hardcore and I'd say 'extremist' vegan if she thinks an ANIMAL is perpetuating the abusive way we produce meat in society. You were only eating fish/dairy so it was easy for her to decide how you would continue your diet. In her telling you that you couldn't date her unless you went vegetarian/vegan, she was testing the waters about controlling your relationship with her.


Now she knows you want to be in a more serious relationship, so she is taking the next step in controlling you and your choices/life. She is making this her 'Hill to die on' and telling you ""It's me or the cat"". If the cat was a deal breaker, she would have never started dating you. It's not about the cat, it's about her forcing you to give up things you care about so you only have to focus on her.


The cat was their first. You made a commitment to that animal to care for it and cherish it. Don't you DARE let a person come into your life, and make these decisions for you. It started with the diet, and now it's your pet. Drop her before it's your best friends and family she wants you to cut out. Or your job. And every time you make a connection outside of the relationship, she threatens to leave you because she wants to maintain control. This red flag is the size of the one over the Kremlin in the 1980s. I know you care about this girl, but you need to do some reflection. Look at other choices you have made that were because SHE wanted you to choose them, not because YOU wanted them.

If she is uncomfortable but really likes you for you she will change her mind and stay. If she only wants a submissive puppet that she can boss around she will leave at the first signes of a backbone. 

Do not give your cat away because of her.",2020-07-20 13:32:05,1,relationship_advice,,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

Mittens adores you & would never bring harm to you, relies on you & in return gives you unconditional love & affection. Her love is conditional.

"This isn't about veganism - she's acting like a brainwashed person adhering to a cult. Its too extreme. Think of overzealous ''christians'' that value things that make no sense. People have this need to belong so bad that they take an ideology and run to the absolute extreme with it - way beyond common sense.

I'm sure she actually cares about the planet and that's why she was attracted to veganism - what I'm saying is she's taking it way too far to the point where it doesn't make sense anymore and her excuse for it is that she's a vegan.

I'm vegan and my 3 cats saved my life many times at my lowest points in life. In a few years when she matures and snaps out of it she'll realize how it made no sense whatsoever but I can see how she's lost right now.

There are no absolute rules to life. You can be 90% vegan and still enjoy a non-vegan meal once in a while without going to hell (hi vegan christians). You can be transitioning into being vegan and have the goal to become 100% vegan but work your way up without doing it overnight.

She's part of the reason why people shy away from including more plant-based options into their diet. The fanaticism is too intense. There is no vegan god that set absolute rules by which you must abide or else you will burst in flames. That's a fabrication from people on the internet looking to belong to something and defend it with their last breath but it just ruins the concept. I think the planet benefits a lot more from having 1000 ''imperfect'' vegans as opposed to having 4 hardcore vegans - and part of the goal of being vegan is to benefit the planet and reduce the meat industry's impact on it.

So yeah no - do not give up your cat. Thats an absolute deal-breaker - you already went out of your way to please her. She doesn't want a mutual respect in your relationship - she wants you to think exactly like her and thats that.

You can be in a relationship with someone that thinks differently without forcing your beliefs down their throats or else. Its called compromising.",2020-07-20 13:26:52,1,relationship_advice,Peteyonline,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"She just wants to control you, don't give mittens up! There is always a way to work together towards some middle ground/compromise. Once the effort has been put in together, and she's still unable to look past Mittens; I think Mitten stays and the other one goes lol

For context, I had 2 cats when I met my fiance. When I introduced them to each other they all loved each other so much! Instant acceptance and cuddles. One of my cats had gotten pregnant, and my fiance took in one of the kittens from her first litter. All of my cats kittens went to his family who never had cats before and to our friends in the same place. All are loved and very well taken care of. 7 years later we have adopted a senior cat and we are all one big kitten happy family. We have 4 cats total. 

Not everybody are cat lovers or animal lovers, but this is such more concerning and to me I would feel the situation was being manipulated by my SO, it's coming down to control.. this wont be the last time she will try to do this. It will continue and worsen if you allow it.

My wife is vegan and I hover between vegetarian and vegan and we have two cats.  I can understand the argument when your cats are indoor/outdoor due to the amount of wildlife an outdoor cat will decimate but if a cat is indoor only then there is nothing non-vegan about the pet ownership.,2020-07-20 13:24:24,1,relationship_advice,dlsco,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"This is going to get lost, but I’m surprised I haven’t seen it yet. Aside from the fact that your girlfriend is asking you to get rid of an animal that you love, that’s been there longer than her, simply because it eats meat (the way that animals do), breaking up because of ideological differences is very common. 

At the end of the day, every breakup is ideological in one way or another. Maybe you didn’t agree on the idea that you shouldn’t be cheated on, or you had different ideas on what your future family life will look like, etc.. If this is a deal breaker, then it’s a deal breaker.

"Listen if you love her and she loves you, regardless on the fact that you’re vegan (how your gf can’t understand the concept that animals need to eat meat in order to survive) she shouldn’t have been asked to get rid of an animal you own.

I know vegan couples that have 4+ cats and a dog and several amphibious creatures.

"In most relationship advice threads I will advocate talking things through and generally dislike the ""omg! Leave them now"" advice that's given. However...

This woman has some sort of mental issues. Please look up something called ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" (BPD), also known as ""Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder"" (EUPD) to see if anything is familiar.

Here's my perception. I imagine she's had a tough childhood. The father will have been awful in some way and the mother will be the one she's closest with, but will be emotionally abusive and unsupportive of her daughter, which yr GF either won't recognise or will refuse to accept. You are a kind and empathetic person who wants to support and ease suffering in others which unfortunately is what ppl like this take advantage of.

If she wasn't vegan she would be just as radical and controlling about other things. I'm going to imagine that if you're honest with yourself there's probably already been quite a few times in yr relationship where she's pointed out where you've been ""wrong"" or ""insensitive"" or ""selfish"" and you've changed and apologised. I imagine she's already caused problems with friends or acquaintances.

If my reading of it is totally wrong, then great. But if anything is familiar here, please run and have nothing to do with person ever again. They are masters of reeling ppl back in.

For clarity. I am very sympathetic to anyone with mental health issues and there are different forms of BPD, but yr gf sounds like one of the toxic ones. They have traits similar to psychopathy and narcissism. Please don't think you can help her because she is not rational, she is incapable of empathising and will ruin your life. You can't help. You have to run to save yourself. She will give the cat away (or worse) when she gets the opportunity.

Apologies for the obvious projection going on here, but I've met too many ppl who've had their lives ruined by ppl like yr gf.",2020-07-20 13:24:07,1,relationship_advice,emptyhead41,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"Honestly that just sounds crazy to me. Also never ever feed a carnivore a vegan diet, so that was a good call.

I always thought vegans do what they do because they love animals and that their main problem is the industrialized killing of animals and the cruelty that goes with it.

Never have i thought that they actually would dislike an animal that eats meat. I mean some even feed them vegan food which is cruel, so some of them actually became the thing they are fighting against.

I am a little lost for words that your girlfriend doesn't see the irony here. She seems quite controlling tbh. and who in their right mind would force the other person to give up a dear pet?

Some vegans seem to forget what vegans used to stand for. They get to obsessed and try too hard to force their beliefs onto others.

They have a whole separate meat freezer just for the dogs, and those animals probably have a better diet than I do.

"Let's keep one thing straight: just because humans decide to not eat meat for ethical reasons, in order to protect animals that currently have so little consideration in the meat industry, doesn't mean animals WHICH HAVE EVOLVED EATING MEAT should do it too! And this is just one of the many things I believe to be wrong in this story. This story is the perfect example of how we humans think we control everything. Don't get me wrong, I'm all in for the animal cruelty free lifestyle, in fact, I try to live by it myself and want to get better at it as I get older, because I, such as any other human being, I'm to be blamed of all of the cruelty! But our cats and dogs don't! Actually, we domesticated them, so I guess they're also our responsibility and we should care for them! And that doesn't mean we ignore the fact that the industry that provides the food we use to feed them, probably suffers from the same cruelty and so we should also try to amenise it. I'm all in with that as well. But I just really don't understand why in this story she is actually blaming the cat for eating what as a cat is supposed to eat... It's actually a huge hypocrisy to wanna get rid of a poor cat in order to save the animals that constitute the meat we eat! On one hand, she's vegan to save animals but on the other she wants to get rid of another type of animal (?) Please, educate yourselves. This ideology of getting rid of the cat because it eats meat is fucked up. I know our industry is fucked, but don't just blame it on a poor cat as well.

"> the very act of owning a pet is a violation of vegan principles.

No it isn't.

As others have said - today it's the cat, tomorrow it will be something else. If you do give up your cat, you won't be happy. She'll just make you jump through more and more hoops until you're finally driven apart, and then you'll be without a girlfriend *and* a cat.

Also, if you submit, she will lose respect and therefore attraction to you. ""Here is a man who doesn't go by his principles because he's desperate to be with me."" It will be the beginning of the end of your relationship. You'll get into more and more arguments, and she will find you annoying because you do what she says.

Tell her to fuck off. Prepare yourself for life without her. If you found one girlfriend, you can find another. Almost all women appreciate cats.

Break up with her first. It will make her head spin. She'll realize she's losing someone who stands up for himself, and she may beg you to stay with her and suddenly find herself having changed her mind about the cat.

I know you want to work things out, you have had a lovely relationship and a beautiful lovestory.

"As a vegan myself, this is bullshit, throughout time we as humans have brought it upon ourselves domesticating animals, therefore, we must uphold that responsibility in caring for them as they can’t themselves anymore. 

Cat also are not omnivores, they are carnivores, requiring a meat based diet, unlike us humans, who have the ability to eat both diets.  So vegan cats go against nature and that is a form of animal cruelty. 

It’s one thing to be an extremist for animal right, it’s another to be young and dumb basing your opinions on how you feel that day, hell, even putting the cat into the wild will cause more harm to our ecosystem than keeping them as an indoor pet.

"I’ve been vegan for nearly 9 years. I’m 22 and just graduated college so I feel like we may be in similar boats here. I’m going to come right out and say that I fucking hate the vegan community- self righteous, pretentious, outspoken, unreasonable. I’ve been on vegan social media for awhile and some of the mess that has gone down has so many people properly blind on how to be patient and compassionate with not only animals but with people who’s lifestyle we don’t necessarily agree with. I’m vegan because it’s the right choice for me regarding ethics, planet, and health but I realize not everyone is the same way. OP’s GF seems to be very unreasonable. You can’t reason with an unreasonable person. 

OP please think about what a future with this GF would look like? What if your future (possible) kids weren’t vegan? How would she act? What if you wanted to go on a double date at a restaurant that had vegan options but the other couple ate a more standard diet? Would she comment on their choices right then and there and ruin the night? What do holidays look like with her? If thanksgiving is with your family and they bring a huge turkey and place it in the middle of the table is she going to freak out and start to pick one with a family member saying “you know that animal was tortured?” 

OP I am so sorry that this has happened, breakups suck but please do not think this is the only unreasonable thing that will come up in your relationship if you decide to continue with her.

"Shes raising red flags as others have said. asking you to change your diet or at least motioning toward that being a deal breaker is a control issue, a decent person would never ask someone to change non destructive behavior. You should never change for someone especially if you haven't got there by your own path, this goes for any aspect of your life.  


Making yourself compatible to someone else's requirements is a huge no no for any relationship, your putting your mental health at risk. ( im talking from a hard life lesson here)  


The cat issue is your line in the sand. shes already expressed some unusual ideas regarding a cats dietary requirements and existence which I'm guessing do not fit your ideologies 

my advice 

Do not financially link with her and I would strongly advise looking at the relationship as a whole.  
Does she try to control other aspects of your life ?

Does she try determine what clothing you wear (non vegan related), or have some favorite items of clothing disappeared?  
 Has she made mention that she doesn't like your friends or do you not see them regularly any more?  or when you do see them does she find reasons to contact you, or for you to return to her earlier than expected.  
Has she belittled you in such a away to get what she wants.

"(not english native, sorry for posible mistakes) Veganism ONLY can apply to HUMANS. Why? Because is a concsious desicion. A carnivore cannot chose suddenly to eat grass, his body is going to get sick. your girlfriend want to force human ethics and moral to an animal.

"Tbh, from this excerpt, she sounds kind of toxic. I’m fine with anyone’s dietary choices, wether it be for health reasons, ethical reasons, or both. BUT, insisting on your cat being an issue for eating and doing what it’s supposed to do, it doesn’t sound vegan-it sounds attention grabbing and controlling. 
As a biologist, I can say that domestic cats do have an impact on ecosystems if they are outdoor cats. But if you keep them inside and neuter and spay them, they will be fine.
Also
Never, NEVER give your cat a vegan diet. Animals evolved to eat meat, such as dogs and cats, can suffer greatly from this. Humans are fortunate that we can have a wide Variety of diets. But for cats and many other animals, it’s necessary for their survival to eat meat/meat products.
Sorry for the rant. Even if she wasn’t vegan, unless it was for health or safety reasons, no one should give you that ultimatum. Pets are family too.

"Coming from a vegetarian (previously vegan), this is absolutely ridiculous. Cats are carnivores and feeding them a plant based diet is just torture and will probably lead to malnutrition or worse. It's like trying to feed a cow some meat - their stomach simply isn't designed to digest it. It could work with dogs since they are omnivorous but I'm still against it because you're forcing your diet onto your pet.

She saying that if you don't get rid of your pet she ""doesn't see a future with you"" is a huge red flag imo. First it's gonna be your pet, then what's next?

This shouldn’t even be  decision for you, but for her to “take it or leave it”.  You’re being treated like an acquisition or status object.

"You might already know your answer by now and what you’re gonna do. But lemme fill you in on a similar experience I had. 

So I dated this girl (we’ll call her butt eater). She was amazing, vegan, outgoing, extremely gorgeous, everything that I’ve been looking for in a woman. By the way, she ate my ass and I was like woah. So anyway, things are going well, and after sex one night, we were talking and somehow the mention of guns come up and I said “oh like my shotgun in the corner of my bedroom?” (It’s in a case that could be mistaken for anything). She froze but I didn’t rly notice and went to bed. 

Later that night we were supposed to meet up with friends and she seemed ok but like not rly herself. Then after a bit, she called an Uber and left in a hurry. Didn’t rly even give me a hug goodbye or anything. I honestly didn’t think much of it. 

A week later, she texts me and says we have to talk about my guns. She threw all these links at me about gun homicides and psychopaths going crazy on their families all with guns. She thought I was going to become that and I was like seriously? You think I’m just gonna become this murderer just because I own a gun after all we’ve been through? Apparently she was a huge anti-gun activist. She either wanted me to ditch all my guns or she’s out. And I’m like aight. See ya. 

But I mean I rly tried at first to talk to her calmly about how I never handle my guns unless I’m going to the range which is like maybe once every 6 months if even. I listened to her but she didn’t listen to me so in the end I said ok I see this is going nowhere and you obviously don’t care about my side of things so I’m gonna end this right now and say we’re done.... but she still kept sending me gun murder articles over text so I had to block her. 

I’m glad I stuck with my decision. She was literally psycho. Like yo butt eater, you rly think I’m gonna turn into a serial killer out of nowhere and just kill my entire family with my sweet Springfield 1911 A1 .45 caliber and bury them out back? Highly doubt that. Very very highly doubt that. I’d kill myself first before hurting another soul. She couldn’t see past how I was as a person and just bucketed me with the rest of the negligent gun owners of the world.

"I'm going to be charitable, but your story sounds like a meat-eater making up an imaginary vegan girlfriend for the sake of a horrendous strawman argument.

In the case you are looking for advice, find out what lies at the bottom of that reasoning. What causes that distaste? Supporting an unethical industry and not wanting to compromise her morals can be the core of her argument - is she against ownership or supporting the industry?

If she is against supporting the industry, you may find that there are alternatives which require a lot of care and planning on your end. By supplying your cat with a carefully planned plant-based diet and access to the option to hunt, you can compromise against industry-related arguments. If the actual issue is ownership, then there is no compromise.",2020-07-20 12:29:20,1,relationship_advice,Captain_Fiddelsworth,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

I don't know why this dietary lifestyle is so attractive to crazy assholes but they are there and they are many. I befriended a vegan once and it took her no less than 3 days before she started telling me how horrible and useless of a human being I was for not being vegan and how everything about me was subhuman. Then when I cut her off she sent me this long message where she started psycho analysing me and my childhood and assume all these things about me having attachment issues. I've also met vegans who have openly said that they look forward to a future where we treat meat eaters the way we treat kkk members.

"Wow, so first she makes you augment your diet to fix her lifestyle, then arbitrarily makes you get rid of your cat because suddenly owning a pet is a violation of vegan ethics and, more ridiculously, the cat kills other animals?!?

This would only get worse and worse throughout a serious cohabitating relationship. I’d pull the chute and get out of this one.

I’m not vegan so it’s really hard for me to take seriously that she’s mad at you for having a cat, to the point it’s contingent on the relationship, because it “kills other animals”. So do wolves, lions, sharks, crabs, seagulls, hawks, etc etc. Hell even lizards eat bugs. Do we need to wage war on all carnivorous and omnivorous species on the planet? Really confused on that one",2020-07-20 13:07:36,1,relationship_advice,jrdull1,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"Jesus Christ. Just because your cat is consuming meat doesn’t mean it stops when it’s out of your house. How does she reconcile the fact that she will be doing harm by abandoning an actual animal because she’s not comfortable with the fact that it eats meat. 

The vegan principal is for humans to not consume meat and live peacefully but the circle of life still exsists. She is doing direct harm to an animal by suggesting you give it away. 

I would throw the whole girlfriend away and start enjoying fish again.",2020-07-20 13:06:27,1,relationship_advice,reegggaaaannnnn,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"I am a vegetarian and am shocked that pet ownership is such a controversial topic in some vegan communities. I became a vegetarian because I love animals and I don't like how they are often abused. That being said, most vegans/vegetarians I encounter are all about rescuing/adopting pets. I have two cats and I couldn't imagine my significant other asking me to abandon them, I would divorce my husband right then and there no questions asked. I don't trust people who don't love animals. 

If you really want to stay with her then maybe you can educate her on the horrors of pet abuse/neglect and how adopting pets and giving them a forever home is much more sustainable. I don't understand how she doesn't want to kill other animals but is cool with your cat potentially dying. And if she does agree, watch out for your cat when you move in. Who knows what she will do to it or if she will give it away while you're gone.

"Keep the kitty, lose the pussy.

The natural state of a cat is to be carnivorous. Hell - the natural state of a human is to be omnivorous. Sure, limiting your consumption of meat has significant health benefits (although, even then, you often need dietary supplements to fill the gaps left by leaving meat out of your diet), but that's beside the point.

The only way you can prevent your cat from consuming meat is to put it on a vegan diet, which is probably not terribly healthy and unlikely to be cheap, or terminating its life. Any other choice is just moving it and the meat it needs to consume out of your immediate vicinity.

If you do that. Whether it would be giving the cat away, or putting it to sleep, you'll resent yourself and your GF for doing it.

Take a beat, have some space, come back to the discussion with the GF and have a balanced conversation. She is welcome to set out her expectations and needs, as are you. Neither of you should need to 100% concede all of your points - it should be about compromising.

"As others have said, this is about control, NOT the cat.  I could completely understand if it was a conversation about potential future pets.  But, it does nothing for vegan principals for you to give away the cat.  The cat continues to consume the same amount of meat.

Regardless of how ""bad"" a cat may be (and outdoor cats are absolutely an environmental nightmare), the only way for this to fit with her ""vegan principals"" is for the cat to be killed prematurely - which would also be a violation of her ""vegan principals"" from my understanding.

"To help strengthen your argument in keeping Mittens and convincing her.

You've already made a commitment to Mittens before you met the girl. Since it is part of vegan principals to not abuse and exploit animals then giving it away would be abuse on the cat.  It will feel abandoned and may develop attachment issues and/or anxiety. There's also a possibility, terrible to think of, that she may be given away again and end up in one of the high-kill shelters that kills 99% of cats. She's not a real vegan if she encourages that abuse and euthanasia of healthy animals, right? As long as you live in a relatively clean place where there are no issues of mice and your cat lives indoors. There should be no issue of hunting mice but toys instead. She should be sensible with the reputable brands of cat food and the symbiotic relationship with animals. 

From what you're saying she have not been raised with cats and because of that she has developed a bias and prejudice towards cats since they are inherently carnivores. Why not encourage her to at least live with one for maybe six months or a year, life of an apartment lease, before she makes up her mind about them?

Also, the extinction of domestic cats is extreme and illogical. Does she also want the extinction of domesticated dogs as well? Then eventually all carnivores? It's harsh to expect nonsentient beings to adhere to a vegan lifestyle or face extinction. What if, down the line, you have children who decide for themselves not to be vegans, would she disown them and give them away?

"I never was a cat owner, my (meanwhile) wife had two cats, one had to be euthanized bebaust of cancer (was spreading and she was slowly dying), with the other one we are currently at the vet.
In the beginning I was annoyed by the car and the car gets a lot of attention by my wife. I don’t think this level of caring is necessary, but I would never ask her to give the cat away. She loves her, and it would be cruel to both of them. If someone forces hood view without considering the cruelty, then this person is doing vegan for the fame to the reason.

If she can't give you your cat, you should question what you will not be allowed to do in future (hang with friends, family..)

"Sensible, nuanced thoughts:

You're in your early twenties. Don't sacrifice your love for your cat over a girl. It makes *no* sense. You should be with someone who can accept you for who you are. You don't have to agree on everything but your thoughts on pet ownership should be somewhat similar

I also thinks it makes no sense that she's expecting *you* to practise *her* beliefs.

I'd just make it clear that mittens isn't going anywhere. I'd be cautious though. Your girlfriend sounds crazy enough for mittens to just go ""missing"" some day.

Actual opinion:

Never stick your dick in crazy. The fact your girlfriend wants to give away mittens means she doesn't give a single shit about animals. She's just really into the vegan ideology and gives 0 fucks about actually contributing to the world. There is nothing wrong with being a carnivore as a cat. It's been shown time and time again that pushing nature out of balance does not improve it.
The reason vegans and vegetarians exist is because of the way we humans acquire, breed and process the meat we eat. Killing for food isn't necessarily animal cruelty. What we do as humans to acquire our food can be seen as animal cruelty.

This is something I never understood about some vegans, do they not know that there are animals that are literally carnivores, as in don’t have a choice what they eat?

And what if you do give up your cat, what then, what about if your cat is not adopted and then put down, God forbid, what about Mittens then when she dies, like is her life not valuable too?

"That's not very vegan of her. Veganism is not about not eating meat specifically, it's about not exploiting animals for human gain. Having a cat is not that. Buying one from a breeder/breeding one is, yes, but not already having one. The cat won't cease to exist if you give her up, she'll still be out there, eating meat. And that's if she doesn't get put down in a shelter because there's too many homeless pets and not enough loving homes. Knowingly sending a cat to a shelter to her possible death is the opposite of everything veganism stands for. Every cat loving rescue worker I've known has been a vegan with like half a dozen cats that they feed a raw, prey model diet of MEAT. And yeah I'd stay the heck away from vegan cat food, humans can make the choice to go vegan and are already omnivores and thus capable of breaking down and getting sustenance from plant matter, cats can't make that choice and are obligate carnivores.",2020-07-20 06:58:57,1,relationship_advice,tehshan,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

From my conclusion of her ideals that all creatures are equal (which I agree with) note that cats are creatures as well and it is part of their evolution to eat meat. Do they not haver the right to live by her standards. Giving up mittens would only cause her to get her meat somewhere else it would not reduce the amount of death.

"Like getting rid of the cat would make things better according to her flawed ideology... it’s one thing to say okay we wont get anymore pets then, but to want to get rid of a pet you already own is ridiculous, uncaring and unhelpful. Aside from the negative emotional impact it would have on you and the cat, she wants the cat to be homeless and live a worse life than it otherwise would as a pet?? And if you rehome it, chances are they’ll be feeding it a similarly meat based diet so whats the better alternative here?? There is none. I sure hope she wouldn’t recommend putting it down bc that certainly doesn’t sound very vegan to me.

What are her thoughts on rescue farms? Should they not have taken them in?
Thirdly, don't even think of buying a home with someone after 7 months lol. You don't know her yet.

"Your girlfriend is a good example of why outspoken vegans get a bad rap.

Look, I’m not a cat person. I’m allergic to them. One of them broke the spine of a squirrel that had made one of our front yard trees his home. I would happily kick that feline’s butt and assert my territory.

However I respect that cats have a meat diet and that they are natural predators. It’s in their nature and there are centuries of symbiosis between humans and cats: I scratch your back, you get my farm rid of rodents.

I would say it’s not that you have to choose between your cat and your girlfriend, but you have to chose between your cat and your girlfriend’s crazies. The choice seems pretty obvious to me.

Giving up on your pescatarian diet was already too generous. Since your girlfriend has the upper hand, she now wants to force all of her views on you, and the type of vegans that she belongs to is beyond reasonable (not that I am putting all vegans in the same *fruit* basket).

Relationships are about finding the middle ground, and you should not settle for someone who only wants it to go *their* way.

She doesn't have the animals in mind. She has some kind of weird, hypocritical concept of moral purity. I know this sub is quick to say ""dump them"" but I mean... I don't know what else to suggest.

Tell her this: if you give your cat away, it still MUST eat. So, the same amount of animals are getting killed in the process. Nothing changes. Either that or you have to kill mittens.

"Man that cat is as much a part of your life as any human can be. It’ll be by your side no matter what. I have 3 cats and I’d die for them. Mittens is family and her asking you to do that is like her asking you to disown a brother or sister. I would talk to her because clearly you love her, just tell her how you feel. “Hey, you’ve made it very clear on your stance of cat ownership and while I respect you and your opinion, I can’t for the life of me get rid of a family member. I hope we can get passed this but completely understand if we can’t.” Give yourself a way out as well, don’t fall into a controlling relationship but if she loves you and cares about you, she will put up with Mittens and who knows maybe eventually learn to love Mittens.

"She is imposing her ""values"" not only on you and Mittens, but also on the entire animal kingdom. She has no leg to stand on here. Cats have been domesticated for thousands of years and it was a mutual move for both cats and humans, the same as dogs. There is a way in which nature works and things consuming other things are a major part of it. There is a constant exchange and she is part of it. How many bugs does she step on daily without knowing it? She benefits from this system even though she doesn't know it because everything in the world begins with this natural cycle. My family and I are vegetarians, some are vegans but nobody can apply this to the rest of nature, it's ridiculous. What gives her that right? How would she feel if some other creature imposed their way of existing onto her? Your cat is here, is yours and you both benefit from it, you and Mittens.

So, that’s just backwards thinking on her end. Also, she thinks we should just exterminate domestic cats? She does realize that having more feral cats would just result in the destruction of surrounding eco systems, right? How many mice and birds would they kill? It’s not like the cat will just eat berries and grass if it’s not domesticated.

">Although the mood soured a bit when my GF sent me a link to a Reddit thread advocating for the extinction of domestic cats.

This isn't just ""a difference in ideology"", that's incredibly fucked up. I know you really care about her and your relationship since you've been together for a while and were ready to take the next step, but how in the world are you considering staying? Not only that, but it's clear that ""\[her blaming\] it on not growing up around cats"" was just an excuse so that she didn't have to deal with fighting you about it right away, there's no way she just developed these views on cats out of the blue. She's probably thought this for a while, and just assumed since you were so far in your relationship together that you'd agree. 

Even putting all that aside, she essentially issued you an ultimatum: her, or the cat. Do you really want to get rid of Mittens over some stupid bullshit? And, no matter how much you love her, do you really want to be with a partner that thinks you getting rid of your cat is more important than continuing to the next step in your relationship?

It’s ok that you aren’t sure how to move forward. It’s really hard when a relationship is going well except for one big dealbreaker. Unfortunately, if your GF isn’t willing to let you keep your cat, it might be time to end things. Mittens came first, and you clearly love her a lot.

"Can you please look up Kittenlady? She is an avid vegan and the most amazing kitten/animal rescuer in the world. My understanding of vegans is they don’t eat animals because of their love for animals but also do not deprive other animals of their natural diets. I’m sorry to say this because I imagine a part of you cares for your girlfriend, but take this as a red flag... stay true to mittens, she is the true girl in your life that will be there for you. Your girlfriend sounds like she’s trying to use this to control you. If she truly loved and cared for you, she would have taken the time to at least give mittens a chance. (Sorry i’m still baffled how someone can be vegan and not like cats—I’m sure they’re out there, but 🥺!).

Edit... as a side note to what your girlfriend is being crazy about regarding domestic cats... something Kittenlady does mention and others advocate nowadays, is to keep their cats indoors to keep them from causing bird populations to go extinct from hunting, as has been proven. Yes the fact is cats do hunt mice and rats which can be quite an issue in certain areas, and truthfully I’d much rather have a barn cat than have to call an exterminator, which can be a fact of life because in certain situations you cannot let those populations get out of control. 

On another side note...I sort of worry your girlfriend isn’t mature enough for you to be moving in with her yet. Take it from someone who had to learn the hard way when they were young... you may not want to give up your place just yet. It really sucks moving in with someone to find out it’s only gonna last a few months and then you have to reestablish your own place again. Just know, there is someone out there who will value you and mittens for all that you are worth, package deal, regardless of both of your eating habits. You’ll know when this person comes along because you won’t have any questions and you won’t need us to tell you to stay true to mittens, even though you know that is the right thing to do.",2020-07-20 05:44:55,1,relationship_advice,iwannagoonalongwalk,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"Bro it’s a cat, if she was pro-animal, wouldn’t she let you keep it instead of potentially putting it in harms way? Also maybe that cat has been a comfort to you, and it’s wrong to have to get rid of your beloved cat. If you do this you’re going to give in and set a STANDARD for your relationship and she will think it’s ok to change things about you if you allow it. 

Don’t lose part of yourself to her. It appears that she’s trying to form you into someone that SHE wants you to be. But what do you want to be? If you don’t even want to do a plant based diet then maybe go back to pescatarian. 

(With the whole Vegan topic.. Also look at the vegan influencers that steal pigs/animals from the farms that treat them poorly, and then they keep them as pets. If she thinks keeping an animal as a pet is wrong then what about this instance? Also it’s a domestic cat! What about dogs? They kill stuff too, some are genetically born to hunt. They also have a meat diet too..)

The best thing to do is sit down with her. I think you need to put her in her place (politely) and tell her that she knew what she was getting into and she CAN’T come in trying to change you.

A lot of the ""What if that was human flesh"" or ""how many animals died to make that?"" sounds like guilt tripping, and if shes heating up on that isn't a good sign. Sure, a lot of it may come from her personal veganism, but guilt tripping like that can be a huge red flag. If you concede to the guilt tripping, It could lead to her continuing to do similar types of things due to result oriented thinking. I know you love her, but stand your ground and don't concede. If she can't deal with you keeping the cat, it's probably for the better anyway, since if you let her do that she may start pulling the same kind of thing with other things in your life she doesn't consider vegan/ vegan enough or just generally as a control method. Im sorry if this made you upset or if I just dont fully get it, I just know that personally, from seeing a relationship too many become that way, It set off several little alarms in my head. Be safe.

"Easy question to ask yourself: Do you see the rest of your life being spent raising kids with a woman who’s so militantly vegan that she doesn’t even approve of having a carnivorous cat in the house? 

Your kids will never be allowed to eat anything that isn’t vegan, and since kids eat what their parents eat she will insist that you also eat vegan.

You will have to explain to your child at every birthday party they attend why they can’t have cake and ice cream like the rest of the kids.

You won’t be able to have another cat or dog as both eat meat.

At family functions she will always make a stink about the lack of vegan options. 

You’ll constantly battle with her over the products you buy, as she will likely insist on all cleaning/hygiene/anything else be vegan and cruelty free.

My man with someone like this you’re looking at a lifetime of walking on eggshells. People who are *this* vegan or into any other type of lifestyle that permeates into every other area of their life needs someone who’s just as militantly sworn to maintaining that lifestyle as they are.

"Well first, you've been with your cat longer than your gf (I'm assuming). And yes I agree, she is nuts. 
I used to work with, and still hang out with this wonderful friend of mine who has been vegan since she could buy her own meals. We worked at a pet store together and was definently vegan not for the dietary benefits but for her infinite love of animals. She will run across the store to let a spider outside instead of letting anyone squish it. 

She has a dog and 3 cats, along with a few other smaller pets. Her dog is totally vegan, and she admitted it took a very long time for her to be comfortable cutting out meat in his diet. She says there are a lot of ways to do it wrong, and if you haven't done your research you will not give your dog the proper nutrition it needs. (This is a yellow lab who is 11+ years and still in excellent health with lots of energy) With all of that, she said she ""will probably never be okay with making her cats go fully vegan."" The girl who cries when having to count to cow feet and pig ear dog treats refuses to make her cats defer from their natural diet. 

Mittens is an animal, and some animals eat meat. You can't expect a lion to live off of grass. If no animals in the world ate meat, our ecosystem would crumble. Its cruel, but it is how our planet functions. To create life we must destroy life. 

I'm sorry you are being made to feel like you have to choose between your pet and your gf. A good partner will learn to compromise for you. Sending love to you and Mittens♡

"You are both so young...sigh. Don’t move in with a partner unless you’ve been together for AT LEAST a year, 2 if you can help it.

Her lack of empathy to try to understand why you’re attached to your cat regardless of her definition of vegan values might come up in other ways you may want to watch out for. Best keep your dwellings separate while you really figure out who this person is because let’s face it, the first year of a relationship always feels easy. 

Plus, if you can hold off on moving in together, Mittens shouldn’t be an issue for her anymore. If she continued to push the issue though, that’s a big red flag.

She wants to dictate your believes and actions, she craves the control and NEEDS to be right. She loves what others think about her, that she’s the hardcore vegan chick.

Also it’s a really shitty thing to do, let things get this far without telling you how she feels about pets like cats or dogs. That in itself is worth breaking up for, it’s not a small thing. She lied, for your whole relationship about what she thinks about your loving cat. Never mind her perspective being shitty (from my point of view).

Alternatively like other users have said she may just be trying to find a really shitty reason to leave you, however I’m not sure that’s accurate considering she sent you actual links to a Reddit thread advocation domestic animal extinction, that seems a little much if you’re just trying to find an excuse to break up.

You even altered your eating habits to appease her — has she ever returned the favor and made a change for you? I’m honestly afraid that she might try to hurt your kitty.
I know breaking it off with someone you care about is a tough decision, but her actions show she doesn’t care about your feelings in this. You’ve been with her 7 months; you’ve had Mittens 3 years... stick with your kitty and find someone who won’t give you such a shitty ultimatum.

If I had known in the beginning, our relationship would have never progressed to anything serious.   I’ve considered divorce several times over this one issue.  We’ve found a compromise but it took almost this entire marriage to reach it.   And, I have to CONSTANTLY remind him that he agreed to the compromise.  It’s a lot of fucking stress that could be avoided by finding someone you are better compatible with.

"Your cat needs to have a carnivorous diet to maintain health. Her being vegan, I must assume that she appreciates the autonomy of live animals. Well Mittens loves you too. Mittens would be hurt by being forced to live without you. This should upset your gf if she truly cares.

I wonder how she feels about all of the carnivorous species on earth. I assume that militant vegans such as your gf are against the human exploitation of life for food, rather than mother nature's ways-

We're fortunate to not necessarily need to eat animals in order to survive heathfully. House cats are not so fortunate. Like you mentioned, one option is to allow cats to go extinct. A much more humane and less fucked up option - as a vegetarian, is to take the path of least resistance. 

House cats can do damage to wildlife, for sure. Though they don't do much damage to the environment while being an indoor cat. We shouldn't sacrifice a brilliant, loving species from the earth, house cats are resource that allows us to use more of the agriculturally raised animals that humans are already consuming. It's illogical that removing house cats from existence will do any good for anyone. It'd only harm them and their humans, plus create more waste in the inhumane industry that we are slowly moving to positively change.

If you want to be with your gf still, I suggest making this and many other practical and pragmatic arguments for keeping your cat. If it doesn't work, then so be it.

I have decided that once my little one passes, I won't own animals that need meat to live healthy lives. Much of what your girlfriend has said, goes against the ideologies of veganism. Mittens is your responsibility, you made the decision to care for an animal to the best of your ability for the entirety of its life and surrendering your cat for someone else or feeding it anything other than meat goes against the notion of holding the quality of your cat's life to the highest degree. I find the argument about cats hunting wildlife in the same vain as omnis who try to argue their meat consumption based upon a lion's diet... because at the end of the day, you have a tiny lion in your home.

"As well as tagging in on what people have already said here, I’ll be adding my two cents at the end:

1. Cat > girlfriend for many reasons. Cat won’t be a bitch to you one day in the future and breakup with you over trivial things
2. Honeymoon phase with cat is forever
3. Cats are obligate carnivores. And whether they’re domesticated or not, out in the wild they will hunt prey and eat it. Mice, birds, you name it. They’ll hunt it, eat it, lick their lips after and take a well early nap
4. Vegan but wants the death of millions of cats? Wtf
5. Thinks telling you to rid yourself of something that is emotionally engrained within you is ok? Even kitty wasn’t, f’n he’ll bitch, cat been around longer than you

And my personal two cents:

The fact that she couldn’t even comprehend the possibility of the previous 5 points mentioned before she stupidly decided one day upon waking that “HEY OMG TODAY IM GONNA BE AN ASSHOLE” and ask such a thing of you is a real show of her lack of thinking processes, logic, emotional intelligence and ability to form coherent logical pathways in her head. Either that or she’s psychopathic and wants to dominate a sense of control over you (any mad precious relationships that she’s been in?) because of whatever reason (but it’s not veganism).

I’m sorry this is a jerky message dude but honestly, stupid people make me really angry. These behaviours of hers are very akin to a few exes of mine and exes of friends. Not just for a romantic relationship, but for everyone in your life; do your best to avoid people that don’t possess any sense of logic, emotional intelligence or wants to dominate you for whatever trivial reason. Their net contribution to your life will NEVER be positive and will ONLY result in the outcome of them leaving a HUGE negative footprint in your life that you’ll still be pissed about years after because it was THAT BAD. Please just trust me on this one man.

And I know you’ll hate hearing this because yeah I’m not that much older than you and you’ve been through enough in life to confidently deem yourself as mature, but trust me man, you will find a MUCH better person, with better bonding, better understanding, better loving, and better ability to stroke cats. You’re 22, it’s super unlikely you’ll meet “the one” at that age (inb4 random OMG AKCHUALLY I MET D LOV OML WEN I WAS LIK 18 AND WE R HAPY EVR AFTER. Yeah ok, congratulations, I said SUPER UNLIKELY not ABSOLUTELY FKN IMPOSSIBLE).

Breakups don’t feel nice, but what the alternative is far worse in magnitude and duration. You give up kitty, you’ll feel dead inside forever and you’ll miss his face and it’ll be too late to get him back before not long. You’ll remember his face and you’ll literally be like OH SHIT and it’ll hurt. You’re his world.

Her on the other hand, first it’ll be this. Next month/ year it’ll be something else trivial. Then another thing and another. And you’ll always try and compromise but it’ll never work. She’ll always take away from you and you’ll be left with less no matter what each time. This pizza ain’t got the toppings for you my brother.

"Your girlfriend is well-intentioned, but she is young and sees things like a fundamentalist does. Cats eat other animals because that is their job, evolutionarily and ecologically. An animal that eats meat is not being cruel or immoral; they cannot survive without eating the diet they are suited for. The idea that you are “supporting” your cat’s “decision” to be a carnivore somehow means you are “responsible” for animal murder is, frankly, the argument of a child. Cats kill and eat rodents and birds. Coyotes and dogs eat cats, and so on and so forth. Her problem is she has control issues. It has nothing to do with anyone else. 

Tell your girlfriend her opinion is disconnected from the reality of the animal kingdom. I guarantee you 100% if you don’t shut her down and create a boundary around this issue, she will get more unreasonable and more controlling over time, you will break up with her, and you will no longer have animal relationships in your life either.

"Yeah that’s a tricky situation. You’re right, cats and pet ownership are a grey area in veganism. Cats being obligate carnivores (dogs can be healthy on vegan diet), they’re one of the pets that must be fed meat.

Your girlfriend seems to struggle in thinking outside her views and genuine empathy. It’s a real struggle for many vegans as our viewpoint is such an easy one to see morally... but the way it’s approached turns so many people off. 

Your girlfriend has a lot of maturing to do with the strategic aspect. She’s clearly passionate, but throwing things in people’s faces (saying eradicate all cats to a cat lover), is a sure way to make enemies and set them against veganism. 

Is there any way you can prompt that empathy? Switch her to think about how she made you feel? Asking her how sending that link would make you feel? It looks like this is a deal breaker for both of you right now. And she’ll likely look back on this with major regret (going vegan for a partner is a big deal already).

Unless she straight up wants mittens put to sleep?

Does your gf have close friends and family that aren't vegan? If she can accept family members CHOICE to eat meat (and hasn't cut contact with anyone who isn't vegan), she'd be very unreasonable to not accept your furry family members biological NEEDS. Maybe you could explain it to her like that?

"You’re a good person for prioritizing your cat here. Don’t doubt that for a second. 

That said, since you’re young, you should be aware that there really are not many long term vegans who own cats, primarily because cats are obligate carnivores. They’re pretty fundamentally incompatible with a vegan lifestyle if someone is hardcore about it. That doesn’t make your girlfriend’s request okay, though; your cat isn’t theoretical, she’s a real and existing part of your family.

Since you want to try to move forward with the relationship, I think it’s worth a serious talk and setting boundaries around Mittens. No talk about the evils of cats or pet ownership to you, no guilting you about Mittens, no asking you to get rid of your cat. Could you see this relationship moving forward where you live separately indefinitely? What if you come to an agreement that no new pets will come into the household and all upkeep of Mittens will be financed by you alone, but that your girlfriend will be civil about and to your cat and respect Mittens’ place in your life? She really needs to understand that this is not a theoretical point in a debate, it’s a real animal that’s already in your life. If she can’t get past that, it’s better to accept now that you don’t have a future together than to put more time into it knowing things won’t change.",2020-07-20 07:28:01,1,relationship_advice,camavity,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"Ah yes, she really cares about animals - wanting to remove a cat from it's loving home to go to a stranger or rescue centre, and give it an uncertain future 😒
Knowing the bond people have with their pets, it's really quite cruel, imo, to expect someone to part with their pet without there being a major health/safety issue with keeping it.
If you can find a compromise with her, which involves you keeping the cat, but perhaps you promise not to get any more pets, or only buy a certain standard of food (which it sounds like you do anyway) then you might be able to work things out. Otherwise, I would suggest ending it now. A relationship were one person has to conform to the other's way of living with no compromise, is not going to be a healthy or sustainable one in the long term- I speak from experience.

"....what.

Either your girlfriend is an idiot, has lost her mind, or never understood veganism at all. I'm vegetarian and I make sure my animals get their meat. I put on fucking dishwashing rubber gloves because I cannot stomach to have meat touch my skin. But I fucking do it. My doggy gets beef as her main ingredient as well as straight bones with blood and marrow still on them to chew. It's good for her teeth. 

My cats get chicken, tuna, and turkey in a meat based gravy. That stuff is easier since it comes in little cups and I don't run the risk of touching it. 

Veganism is about balance and helping all living things thrive. Birds eat living things, mice, dogs, bears, horses, etc 

There are not many animals that DONT eat other animals. If she is calling for the extinction of all meat eaters it would literally destroy the earth. That is veganism that's Thanosism

"But... Mittens is ALSO an animal. Animals don't have the sentience or physical composition to diet ""cruelty free."" If she cares about animals so much, why does she hate cats? Does she hate all carnivorous/omnivorous animals? 
The lack of logic leads me to believe that something deeper is happening here - be it shady or mental health related. 
On the other side of this, that is unfortunately how a relationship comes to it's end. More often than everything being all bad, there is a deal breaker for one or both sides that negates the good.

"I don't think she wants an excuse to break up but mostly a way to control you even more. 

Her extreme way to live and think might hide several unchecked mental health issues. You know it's as if she was constantly pestering you about losing weight, doing more sport and suddenly, as you think you will move in with her, she told you that you have to never eat any more cake or sweets in your life, because it's bad for your health and she will not be with someone who encourages the sugar lobbies, sending you articles about how it's bad and how she is right. It's more about her need for control than anything else. Imagine if it was a mom telling their kid they have to kill their pet if they want to come home after college or saying they have to swear they will never ever eat sugar anymore.

She even might be brainwashed by PETA, who is known to have those extreme views on vegan pets but also known to kill animals, even in animal shelters that don't belong to them, many shelter volunteers are trained to be around people at all times to avoid water being poisoned. (I know it sounds weird but you can easily Google it or even find threads on Reddit about that). The fact that she sent you an article advocating for the death of cats says that she has no empathy nor compassion for you or animals, it's all about control. 

About being extremely compatible, she could also be a narcissist, who generally are very charismatic and match you in every way, until they have to make a compromise. It is impossible for them, you are the one to have to do it and most often, it is sacrificing the way you live, your friends, your family, your pets, because they demand so with crazy reasons. By the way, the ""bomb"" she dropped  on your lap after a while was made on purpose, she knew you would walk out if she told you about how cats should die since the beginning. And since you won't have a cat to distract you from giving her attention, it's even better to her.

Dodge that bullet OP, Mittens is your real companion here. Btw, don't think that your girlfriend will change her views even if she says so, most probably she will kill or poison your cat and tell you to get over it, as it was itself a killer.

"Your gf doesn't sound like a very logical person. To advocate the death of all house cats is a bunch of crazy talk. Serious red flag. 

You can't talk about loving animals and not be able to accept their nature. Nor does that makes sense that she loves animals enough to not eat them, yet backups a group that wants housecats dead. 

Not every animal can be vegetarian, it would make them very sick and kill them being on a unsuitable diet. Also we need carnivores, they control the population of other animals that otherwise could unbalance different ecosystems. Take barn cats for an example, without them farmers would have crazy rodent issues with their crops among other things.

It's inhumane to want to give a carnivore a vegetarian /vegan diet. It's also selfish and inconsiderate that your girlfriend is making you choose between your cat and her.

"Okay this is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever read. Veganism and vegetarianism are concepts created by humans for humans. People choose to forgo eating meat and animal products and byproducts for various reasons because they can make a conscious decision to do so and they have the means to supplement their diet with for the necessary vitamins and minerals. Animals cannot make this decision. They’re either carnivores, herbivores, or omnivores. They don’t think like people do so they can’t make that decision. So to say that domestic cats aren’t “vegan friendly” is beyond stupid. 

The real issue, at least for me, is that your girlfriend doesn’t seem to care that Mittens means a lot to you. That is a major red flag. Someone who doesn’t care about things that are important to you is not someone that you want in your life. Even if everything else is great the fact that she wants you to give up something so important shows a complete lack of respect.

"OP, your GF (soon to be ex) sounds like a control freak. 

There is nothing wrong with becoming vegan but force your ideologies on others, especially when it comes down to the well being of certain creatures to strictly have a meat diet, she is absolutely out of her goddamned mind. 

It sounds like your GF is trying to exert control and influence on you to be culled to what she finds acceptable. I’m sorry, but that’s not how relationships are with people. She sounds insufferable TBH and I don’t know if I’d say she is using this as an excuse to break up with you, but I suppose crazier things have happened. 

You are young OP. Heartbreak sucks balls, but do not bend on your convictions if you feel strongly about them. Your soon to be ex definitely hasn’t given a second thought about her own. The difference is however, you aren’t flexing your emotional muscles over her to manipulate her into agreeing with you. She’s pulling the classic emotional hostage tactic. That’s grossly unfair especially when you guys agreed early on to hang at her place more because she was uncomfortable around your cat. If she really felt so strongly, before getting serious she could have said “the cat is a deal breaker for me if you ever consider having a serious relationship with me, how do you feel about that?”

Sorry OP, it may be cliche, but there are plenty of fish and it just sounds like this one got snagged for the fish market.",2020-07-20 05:21:32,1,relationship_advice,realistSLBwithRBF,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

Like isn’t the idea of promoting cruelty free lives for animals the point? The stupidity. And yes a vegan diet for animals can be detrimental. 

Also an added piece of Info no one asked for.

I think a big issue is that she isn't even willing to try to get to know the cat...or have Mittens get to know her.

Also say you get rid of the cat, how long would it take for her to try to make you a vegan? Would you do that to make her happy after she made you get rid of a companion?

If she doesn't want to care for animals that's fine, but you'd be doing Mittens a disservice by tossing her(?) off somewhere else just to be more ~ethically consistent~. Everyone is just doing the best they can. If you want to try to work it out, maybe it would help to assure her that Mittens is an obligate carnivore and all the feeding will be done by you.

"Who the fuck expects a carnivore to go vegan? Maybe she should go kill all carnivores so all the poor little prey animals will be safe. Some animals kill other animals and if they stopped the ecology would be fucked. I mean a Vegan advocating intentionally killing and entire species is ironic.

Seriously tho. I don't like pets and I don't want them. But I would never ultimatum a cat out of someones life If I care about them. I would just try to influence never replacing the cat. 

So I am not in defense of mittens but generally appalled by a belief system that ascribes morality of an animals natural diet. 

Humans don't have to eat meat so I respect the decision of people who make dietary choices. But your GF using the relationship status to push her morals on you in the first place is sketchy. And it looks like she is trying to do it again. 

My opinion from this limited information is this. She doesn't love you as you are she loves you as how she wants you to be. If she loved you as you are she wouldn't be doing these things.

You already gave her so much control by *changing the way you eat* for her! This probably gave her a big high, and now she wants more control. They are always looking for more ways to satisfy their need for control. She may even be a narcissist and is just now revealing herself. No joke.

Edit* - it could be important to explain to your girlfriend, whether you are the owner of the cat or not, the cat will eat meat.

"I'm a vegan and whether I disagree or not, I  understand the argument that we shouldn't have pets. I also believe that a relationship can end, or even not start, because of different ideology. I don't think I'd be in a relationship with a non vegan, but what you gf is doind, even though she doens't agree with animals being pets, is basically animal cruelty. How come do you live with a cat that loves you and is loved back and a person who advocates for animals just says ""well just get rid of him/her because that's wrong"". Wrong or right the fact is that this animal is already a pet and theres nothing to be done about it.

What will you do? throw them on the streets so they can be free and have a miserable life or give them to a shelter where theyre gonna have a even worse life than on the streets? and for what? So then you can live by the ""rules of a vegan life style"" that's just crazy.

I don't know what your gf has in mind, but I don't really believe it's the vegan thing. I'm a hardcore vegan and for that exact reason I would never ever put some rule or believe or whatever this, is above an animal well being. Getting rid of your cat is just cruel. This animal will suffer so fucking much I don't believe any vegan would suggest that.

I hate reading reddit comments here because it's just people telling other to end their relationship, but honestly, I don't see this chick of yours being a good person and I would not want to spend my life with a person like this.

"Do not, under any circumstances, feed your cat anything but meat-based food. Cats are not designed to be frugivores, herbavores, etc. It will kill them. 

Coming from pescatarianism and veganism myself, I can tell you that she will not change her mind about this. She may end up begrudgingly accepting that you want to keep the cat, but she will most likely try to convince you on and off. It is a controversial topic amongst the vegan and vegetarian communities, and you two will have to agree to disagree. 

But that being said, her asking you to part with an animal you have developed a bond with is ridiculous.

"Does your soon to be ex advocate for the “extinction” of all meat eating animals?  What about dogs?  Dogs are meat eating.  How about lions?  Eagles?  Dolphins?  Otters?  A domestic cat kept indoors will not kill and eat anything.  A cat kept indoors who kills a mouse that is in your house is doing you a favor, as mice and rats spread disease.  If there were no predators, prey animals would soon over take the earth and then die slowly and painfully from starvation.  

Also- being a vegan is not without its cruelty.  Do you know what farming does to the land and local wildlife?  Does she know if her soy or pea or almond farmer shoots coyotes to invade their farms?  I bet they do.  Do they employ methods to reduce rodents and insects that can decimate the crops?  I’m sure they do.  Even using organic methods result in the death of bugs and rats.  Huge farms strip forests and natural prairies, they also fuck up water supplies and create pollution.  

So unless she is growing ALL her food, or at the very least buying only from local farmers, grinding her own wheat, never using paper, Hardwood, plastic, using solar panels for power, she isn’t being totally cruelty free.

"I've been vegetarian for 10 years and vegan for 2 years. I've had a dog the entire time and I feed him meat.

My vegan choices are for me, and me alone.

Your girlfriends ideas sound a bit radical. I think it's up to her to do what she wants, and if she thinks having a cat is against her principles then she has the right to remove herself from the relationship.

I find it concerning that she didn't bring this up sooner. Maybe it's a power trip of some sort. I would say if she is requesting you to give up something you love and you are just 7 months in, there is the possibility of more unreasonable requests further down the line. This isn't someone I personally would be interested in staying with, I would want someone a bit more in touch with reality vs. trying to make her ideal a reality, but it's your call.

Even if Mittens were given away, I'm not seeing how that would help her argument since Mittens would still eat. Maybe she is concerned about how having Mittens impacts her vegan image.

I kind of think her request is a bit ridiculous. Good for you on not compromising on Mittens. 

When I met my husband, I already had my dog who I love. My dog is always by my side (he is right now) and I find having a pet is a rewarding relationship, as I can tell you do too. Fast forward many years, my husband LOVES my (now our) dog, and our dog loves him in return. At night, our dog gets out of his bed and sleeps on the floor next to my husband. I love seeing the relationship they have. When you find a partner who loves your pet like you do, it makes an extra special relationship. My advice would be let the girlfriend go and find someone who already has a mindset like hers, and leave yourself open to find someone you will like just as much as your current girlfriend who will also love Mittens ❤️

Good luck with whatever you decide.",2020-07-20 05:06:16,1,relationship_advice,Vandraphe,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"Toss the girl, not the cat. She's being ridiculous and asking you to give up an important part of your life for her delusional ethics-boner. And I find it hypocritical that she's offended that the cat would eat rodents in the wild, and thus thinks they should go extinct because of it or be ""gotten rid of"". And giving away the cat doesn't make the cat not be eating meat. The only way to do that would be to put it down - which would mean killing an animal. Not very VEGAN. 

Veganism is fine, and there are perfectly valid reasons for doing it. But pretending the food chain doesn't exist naturally and animals are bad for being animals is just delusional.  

And I sure as hell wouldn't be throwing away a loved pet for a seven month college relationship. When you break up in a year or two anyway you'll look back and kick yourself for losing your doomed relationship AND your cat because of it.

Just break it off now and find someone who isn't....low-key crazy. And selfish. And a myriad of other things. It sounds like she's expecting you to make major sacrifices without making ANY compromises on her part.

Obviously you’re not in the wrong for properly caring for your cat. You would be morally wrong if you tried to make your cat vegan, because that’s not possible for a cat and you would harm her by doing this.

"What does she want you to do about the cat exactly? Giving it away isn’t going to solve anything as the cat is still a cat, so that would only cause the animal stress.

Or when she means get rid of it, is she using a euphemism for killing it? Does your vegan girlfriend want you to kill your cat? Can you get her to say that’s what she wants? If she uses a greater good argument? What about people? Should we kill them too if they eat meat? Ok ok that’s silly she means animals. Well wild predators kill other animals, should we get rid of those too? No? So why is your cat such a big deal? Is this virtue signalling where she doesn’t, deep down care, but doesn’t want to be seen with a cat, so she can feel pure?

She sounds like a horrible person but if you want her and the cat you could make it an indoor cat.

"Mittens is a dependent family member and has been for 3 years. Re-homing her would cause some level of psychological damage for both you and your cat.  The fact that she OK with hurting you and Mittens is not OK.  As far as I can see there are four things that can be going on.

1. Your GF has gone off the Vegan deep end.  This is definitely a possibility as she is spending time online communicating with groups that think the extinction of any type of animal is a good thing.
   1. Do you know of any of her friends that may be able to talk to her about this?
2. She has a fear of cats  and rather than get over that fear she would rather get rid of the cat. 
   1. Exposure therapy is usually good for this.  There are lots of cute cat videos out there. Then slowly build you to her spending time with Mittens.
3. She wants to control you. You getting rid of a beloved companion would prove to her that you lover her more than you love your cat. Has she requested that you not talk to certain friends/groups? Has she requested that you change you behavior in any way?Has she requested that you **prove** that you love her in anyway? 
4. That she want to break up but she wants you to be the one to do it? This way it is not her fault the relationship ended.

"Keep the cat and ditch the girl. I genuinely do not think it is unreasonable to break up with someone over that, especially because Mittens has been an important part of your life much longer than she has. I could understand if her reasoning was something like having a deadly allergy that can’t be compromised about, but a fundamental misunderstanding of animal biology and needs isn’t a good enough reason to ask you to get rid of a beloved pet.

Also, I’m genuinely concerned about her obvious science denialism. Like, does she think wild cats and other predators are also bad because they’re obligate carnivores? Does she think they should be forced to eat vegan, somehow? Does she think other types of carnivore should also go extinct—something that would devastate the environment and the animals she probably claims to care about?

And how do you know that that’s where her science denialism stops? Somebody like that could very easily make the jump to being an antivaxxer. Is that really the kind of person you want to date long term or settle down with?

Finally...you’ve been dating for less than a year. Don’t go moving in together and for the love of GOD don’t BUY a home together.

"Good for you for sticking up for mittens. I think its important to remind her that cats are ""obligate carnivores"" meaning they literally have to have meat or they will die. If not die certainly not thrive. Cats have to kill. It doesn't make sense to literally say a whole species of animals shouldnt be included in your life because they naturally need to eat other animals. 

This is coming from someone who was vegan for a few years. Meanwhile my ex partner has been vegan for over 16 and she absolutely adores cats, has one, and feeds it a purely meat diet. And don't even get me started on vegan dogs ( dont make animals vegan). 

I think its important to remind the gf that its important to love animals as they are naturally. 

Also make sure to look how strict she is for herself? Not to say "" got ya"" but to think about her reasoning. 

Does she use/ wear leather, does she use honey? 
Does she eat french fries from mc donalds? Or curly fries from jack in the box? Does she occasionally let an egg included ingredient slide? 

If so, why is she really wanting you to get rid of mittens. Its absurd to give up love for an animal in the name of loving animals.

"As an ex vegan (I’m pescatarian now for health reasons, but that doesn’t matter), who is also an owner of two cats and a dog, I can honestly say your gf is a crazy vegan. First of all, she knew you had a cat since the beginning so if it was such a deal breaker for her then she should have just found someone else who has her exact same views or at least someone who doesn’t already own a cat. Her practically giving you an ultimatum, her or Mittens, is also such a red flag. You don’t just give up a pet when it’s not convenient for you anymore. That’s not how it works. Let’s are family. And you know what? She’s just a girlfriend. I think you’ll be doing both yourselves a favor by eliminating her from the picture. 

I’d also like to point out that cats have already been domesticated years ago and whether we like it or not they co-exist with humans now and won’t be able to survive in the wild. Cats are also not herbivores by nature. Vegan cat food is terrible for cats, they’re supposed to consume meat! It’s in their nature.

What actual vegans are against is humans eating animals because ""we know better"" or something like that, right?

If you think about it this is really her fault. She knew you had a cat despite her own feelings about it and still tried to continue a relationship.

If she is not able to accept your fur baby, then it may be hard, but you may have to end it with her. I would sit her down first and let her know that there is no way of you getting rid of your cat. She may come to her senses, because honestly if a domestic cat is an indoor only cat then they won't be killing animals anyways. Plus it is more humane to look after a domestic cat in this modern world as there isn't much food out there for them (or it is usually contaminated), and after 2 days of no water their kidneys will shut down, plus the chances of them being hit by a car or being purposely killed by a stranger is high!

She's extremely controlling and she has managed to keep that part of herself hidden from you until she felt comfortable that you were in love with her and getting serious. So now she thought it was safe to start showing that side of her character. Although this particular demand is about Mittens, I guarantee if you caved on this, it would only be the beginning of her attempting to control every aspect of your life.

It also seems like she has no problem trying to change you. She did ask you to be vegan, which you may or may not have done on your own. Only you know that. However, asking you to get rid of (and in the process HURT) another being is a way if trying to change you.

Her ultimatum isn't fair or reasonable at all. This is where you have to put your foot down, because even if you'd give in now, there might be similar situations down the line where she will come up with other ultimatums. This is extremely emotionally immature behavior.

"Personally I wouldn't want your GF in the home after this, I wouldn't be able to trust her around Mittens. She's clearly kind to animals, but finding Mittens has been given to a shelter would have repercussions if it happened to me. 

My cats are elderly and I do relate. I've dated quite a lot in that time, clearly not in many serious relationships, but one of the first things I check for is how they relate to my cats. The response is overwhelmingly positive in general, but there have been a few where I've ended it immediately. One date actually asked if I'd get rid of them for her on our first (and last) date. 

My cats are a fundamental part of my life and have been for many years. They've seen me through times good and bad, there is no way I'm swapping them for the sort of person that would expect me to make that swap.

"I'm not a vegetarian nor do I attempt to be one. But I can easily see the logic of your girlfriend and it is partially right. 
The point where I personally would think she is not right, is what I can offer you as a place to go on from.

Owning cats is even without being vegan disputed. They kill to many birds. From a vegan point of view, the meat for feeding has to be produced as well. 
So I think your gf is right. It makes sense to not own a pet when being a vegan. (But people are different and have different motivations for being vegan. )

The other side is Mittens is already there. He will eat and hunt anyway, whether he lives with you or with someone else. It' s as well unethical and serves no purpose to give it up now. It is also unnecessary cruelty towards the owner. 

You are allowed to sometimes take your own well-being into consideration, too and every relationships thrives on compromising. You want this, she wants that. Someone gotta give in. She's gotta be aware of that. Constant and effortless compromising is absolutely essential to a happy relationship.

Thats nature.

She cant stop your cat from being a cat. Thats how cats are.

"Alot of manipulative people will try to condition said partner (victim?) with certain requirements during dating. A big red flag can be found when someone wants you to completely sever a bond with a pet; this lets them know it's easier to manipulate someone into severing contact with other people like friends and family.

If she says she doesn't see a future with you unless you do x, that sounds like a very conditional relationship. It may have been easy for you to go vegan, however it sounds like she doesn't know the art of subtlety yet which is a blessing for you. This exposes her conditional affection and is somewhat of a forewarning for you should you continue this relationship. 

I know it sucks, but I would recommend you break up with her. You've known and bonded with your cat for 3 years, that's usually not something you flip a switch on and can cause alot of grief both for you and Mittens. 7 months of dating someone who seems very conditional just does not compare.

The exception to all this would be if your gf was allergic but seeing as how that is not the case I think what's happening here is a red flag you should be aware of.",2020-07-20 09:21:53,1,relationship_advice,awkwardfloralpattern,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"Long story short, get a better partner.  


A good partner doesn't control everything your do or have. She's downright evil and needs to vanish from your life.  
Also, cats need animal based meat to survive. Vegan cat food is torture.  


It's okay you torture yourself with your diet, but cats are one of the carnivorous animals that cannot live off vegan food.  


And yes vegan cat food is bullshit. It's been proven that cats living off that quickly develop fur problems, like cruffy textures, greasy fur, and they'll lose weight.

"I met alot of vegans. Call it luck or coincidence, i don't know.

From what I've realized there are good ones and there are irrational, crazy ones.

Good ones will base their reasoning of being a vegan on rational arguments. One common example is the bad conditions animals have in the slaughter houses. The term slaughter house itself is horrifing too. They make good arguments, they speak with sense. But most importantly, they are absolutely respectful of others.

Your SO on the other hand is on the irrational side, slowly shifting towards the crazy...

Her arguments make no sense. She is giving ultimatums which means she is not respecting others' choice of not being a vegan.

"Sounds like you two have a real incompatibility here, and I think that it's good that she's shown this side of herself before you get too serious.  She seems uncompromising in a way that I wouldn't find comfortable in a relationship.

For one, she basically made you go vegan before even considering you for a relationship.  Now, not even that is enough -- she doesn't want to share a home with an *animal* whose evolutionary and dietary needs run contrary to her ideals, even if that animal means a lot to you.  Not only this, but instead of being upfront about it, she waited until you had an emotional investment in her before presenting this as a dealbreaker.

"What!? 

I’m vegan and I think this is crazy. The definition is veganism is “to reduce suffering where practically possible” but that’s only because as humans we have a choice. Cats are obligate carnivores, they have to eat meat. You personally aren’t doing anything wrong by owning the cat just like you’re not doing anything wrong when the tiger in Africa goes hunting. It’s apart of nature and when animals do it they manage to keep in in balance whereas when humans farm animals and consume them it literally means we are killing our planet and subjecting an animal to enslavement and torture for the it’s entire life. When a cat catches a mouse it’s not that bad. 

If you own a cat already it’s not your fault it goes hunting etc. I thinks it’s wrong to own a cat simply because i believe we shouldn’t have domesticated them in the first place and we could just let them be free in the wild. But that’s not reality and people own cats even before going vegan. The practical solution isn’t to give it away. It’s to keep it and not buy new ones?! You will cause yourself suffering and end up resenting your GF over it in the long run. 

When I said veganism is to reduce suffering, that means yourself.",2020-07-20 09:43:07,1,relationship_advice,masque_raen,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"A woman should be a compliment to your life not the focus. And she's forcing her way of life on you make herself the focus not you.

Here's how it works. You already switched your diet for her. She is starting to push things further. The problem with giving in as a man on stuff you value is that she will walk all over you. A woman doesn't respect a man she can walk all over and will always see how far she can go. Prince Harry and his current wife is nice example of it in the media. So first she forces you into her diet. Seconds she wants you to get rid of Mittens who you love. 3rd... imagine something outrageous. So... here's what I would do. If she's really serious, make it clear that Mittens comes along with you. If she has a problem with that, you'll end the relationship and once ended you don't reverse the decision.

Not to mention, she should’ve said it bothered her when people own cats in the first place. A simple “I’m a bit uncomfortable with humans owning pets” would’ve given you an idea of where she stands.

So while she's right that your cat should be kept inside, because domestic cats are a leading cause of birds disappearing, she has no right to tell you what to do with Mittens, who was here before her.

"This reads like that Futurama episode where they discover poplers, and those vegan protestors show off their dying, malnourished lion saying they taught it to eat tofu. 

It’s fine to have your opinions on meat consumption as humans, because our meat industry is very cruel. That, however, doesn’t change the fact that other animals have different dietary needs, and yes... animals eat each other. 

If your girlfriend actually cared about the well being of animals, she would understand that it is imperative for carnivores creatures to hunt and consume other animals. Or is she okay with all carnivorous species slowing starving to death and soon extinction? That would lead to overpopulation of herbivore species, which would cause food shortages for all of them, and so they would also slowly starve to death and soon become extinct. 

I agree that it’s very sad that something must die so that others may live, but it is the natural, beneficial order of all ecosystems. Your girlfriend seems to have very irrational and radical views on the subject matter, but I suggest you sit down and try to explain all of this to her, given you want to work out.

"Veganism is about boycotting the exploitation of non-human animals whether pets are part of that is something that can be argued for but giving away your pet isn't going to be helped. The proper option would then be to release them in the wild which you can be certain off won't make the cat any happier.

If a cat were to hunt down a mouse I would simply say: ""that's nature."" These mice aren't forcefully bred or force fed or kept in captivity, nor does the cat really have the moral understanding that it's harming the animal.

Although I would prefer it, I understand that giving a vegan diet to a cat is, well, challenging, to put it mildly. It will cause suffering to simply feed your cat but in the grand scheme of things... I don't agree but I do understand. Humans (and even dogs, but that takes effort) can survive just fine on a vegan diet but for cats I'm not sure if that's an option.",2020-07-20 09:51:36,1,relationship_advice,PauLtus,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"I’d choose the cat. Tbh she’s being a bitch for making this ultimatum. Real lovers of animals (a massive influence in those who become vegan) would not give up an animal. That’s so heartless to do! You have a bond, love and relationship with your cat. To give her up over *your girlfriends* diet choices is a terrible reason, that’s not showing love to animals imo. Cats can not live off vegan diets, it’s unnatural for them and causes many health issues they may not recover from. I’m glad you’ve done research and educated yourself on veganism and it’s harm to animals when their diets are switched. I do not recommend moving further with this relationship. No love is worth ditching your commitment to your pet. I do not think your girlfriend will back off on this issue. 

Hope you are able to resolve this without rehomeing/taking your cat to a shelter (not recommended, they get rotated to other shelters and cats are always high risk at being put on *the list*). Hoping the best for you and mittens! What a wonderful name!

Edit: also not blaming veganism for this way of crazy thinking. I’m rather displeased she’s using her dietary choices as an excuse to kick he cat out.

"She’s a devout vegan with a ‘cruelty-free’ lifestyle but is reading about the advocacy of the extinction of domestic cats? Something doesn’t add up here. Because wanting an entire species to go extinct doesn’t sound ‘cruelty-free’. 

OP, I totally understand that you love your girlfriend but she does not sound like the sharpest tool in the shed. There has to be compromise in a relationship and you’ve already done all you can to help your girlfriend feel at ease by not spending time at your apartment. 

Make sure you stand your ground on this one because Mittens is acting on her natural instincts which is to hunt, and has done nothing wrong. Cats cannot live a vegan lifestyle as it can do them damage and is animal cruelty here in the UK. You’re doing all you can, buying decent cat food brands. As a decent human being, and cruelty-free vegan, your gf should not demand you get rid of her. That is cruel. 

Whatever you do, do not give up your cat!",2020-07-20 09:53:15,1,relationship_advice,War_Goddess96,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"I appreciate what is written in most comments and you definitely made the right choice. However, there may be a way that you can safe your relationship and keep Mittens firmly in the picture. 

You write in a very loving way about your GF. Assuming that you are in a loving and respectful relationship in which both of you have invested a lot, the question should be asked why suddenly the pint of Mittens has become such a deal breaker. 

The answer may be lurking in something you said in your post. You became known as ‘that vegan couple’ on campus. This touches on something about going vegan. For some it is simply a dietary preference or lifestyle choice, but for others it has become much more than that. There is a whole vegan community and they do a lot more than exchanging recipes. They apply scrutiny to other members, excreting peer-pressure and an almost cult like fanaticism approaching each other with a holier than thou attitude (check any vegan subreddit for confirmation). For her, her status as a vegan and her standing within the more toxic parts of that community may be what defines her. This means that not your cat, but her whole image of self-worth is at stake here. As her BF, she should expect you to help her. Not by getting rid of your cat, but by helping her to put the more toxic elements of her community behind her. 

Pizza lovers may resort to a hissy fit regarding the legitimacy of pineapple as a topping, but they usually don’t define themselves by this particular lifestyle choice. Certain vegans do and forget about other defining aspects. Now you are on the proverbial break, you can have a long hard think about your relationship so far. You went vegan for her. Did she appreciate this? Has she made similar compromises? If you decide that the relationship is worth saving, you have to get her to see that she is too far down the vegan rabbit hole. In the end it is just a lifestyle choice and there is no ‘right’ way to live your life, but there is a way that is right for you. If you can help her to see that, you will make a big positive impact on her life and hopefully on your relationship with her. 

Try some casual dates, no pressure on either side, but try to do things that both of you like that don’t involve veganism. Try to complement her on being good in her field, a good dancer, musician, orator, lover, chess-player (whatever, as long as it is something else than being a good vegan). When she can feel confident and proud in being something else than half of ‘that vegan couple’ she may again take pride in being part of a couple full stop, and realize that she doesn’t have to defend having Mittens around to anyone. 

Whatever happens though, don’t give up Mittens. Giving Mittens up, will make you resent your GF for the rest of your relationship.

"Honestly, I think that the fact that she won't tolerate anyone who doesn't have the same 'cruelty-free values' as a red flag because a relationship isn't about being one entity with the same values and qualities. If she's a vegan why is she supporting the extinction of domesticated cats..? 

I thought vegans were supposed to advocate for animals and their rights? Mittens has a right to eat meat - she/he/insert respective pronoun is a carnivore, as Crafty\_Birdie has pointed out. If your gf is aware of the fact that Mittens has digestive issues, she's being extremely insensitive. 

Also, why do your friends think she wants to end the relationship like this? Has there been a previous event in the relationship where your gf has said that she 'can't see a future with you unless...?' 

I'm afraid the issue here isn't really about Mittens..I suggest asking her why she decided to drop the bombshell then. 

I hope the situation works out well for you OP!

"I’m not a vegan myself, I do respect veganism for the right reasons but I just cannot get behind shit like this. That you make a choice to eat less or no meat does not mean you should force someone else to do it as well. Human or not. The fact the she needed you to move vegan as well seems like a red flag to me from the start. If she wants to be with you she wants to be with you. She’s trying to change your morals here. Change who you are. Things like this are not love. She might just ‘love’ who she wants you to be. I’m sorry you’re going through this and that you didn’t see the sings of this sooner. And ofcourse I don’t know all of your relationship but of what I read I feel like it wouldn’t work. However, I too have different morals than you.

"First off, I've never heard of a vegan being so unloving to animals! 
Giving the cat away doesn't solve the problem that she has with it. If you give it away, the new owner will still have to give her meat to eat, because that's what cats need. So to solve her problem, she would have to kill Mittens, which is the opposite of why she became vegan in the first place. 
Being vegan also means to respect every living and breathing being, which she doesn't obviously. 
Mittens is there and she's your cat, all that you can do is to castrate her/him, so there won't be any offspring. 
Little Mind-Experiment: Imagine you'd save a pig from the slaughterhouse and took it home, to care for it and let it have a good life... Would she appreciate that or would she want to get rid of that pig, too? Because pigs do eat everything, even meat, if you feed it to them. And in some countries cats are on the Meal-Plan.

"Cats evolved to eat meat. How is giving it away solving its evolutionary history?

Humans can choose to eat or not eat meat. Cats cannot. Meat eaters serve an evolutionary role too- take all the studies on how environment is affected when keystone predictors were removed and how landscapes and ecosystems reverted when they’re brought back.

Lastly, cats are not really domesticated. I mean yes they are pets, but aside from a few select breeds- most are mutts that are perfectly suited to hunt and live in the wild if they weren’t born or adopted as pets. 

That being said- relationships have to work for both of you. If being in a completely meat free environment is critical for her then it is. If she can be truly convinced great- at the end of the day you both have to value each other and shared values you have over any differences to make it work.

But, I have to question the priorities of anyone who values an ideal over responsibility, love, and family (since for a lot of people pets are family)

It’s possible part of it is - people who don’t like/have pets have a hard time understanding that they are not just an accessory to your life.",2020-07-20 09:29:02,1,relationship_advice,Blankbit,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"Usually I try to be understanding and sympathize with both sides, but as someone whose job is animal care... Your girlfriend is an idiot. One way or another, carnivorous animals are always going to exist. You can’t up and ask fucking nature to stop doing its thing. The most cruelty free way to own a cat is to feed them their nature-intended diet, which includes meat. I always thought veganism had some principle about allowing nature and animals to be as they were meant to be. 

The expectation that veganism bars you from owning a companion animal that requires meat is incredibly stupid. Your ethical values should NOT affect your pet’s health.

Maybe try to explain to her why she’s wrong but honestly I would drop the relationship as a whole.

"She is dilusional. It will be pretty hard to snap her back to reality.

Getting rid of Mittens will change literally nothing! There will be tons of cats(that are beyond anyone's control) that will hunt for mice and other creatures anyway. Besides, mice, rodents are designed to breed a lot so it will never go extinct.

Cats hunting species to extinction is because humans put them there purposefully or accidentally.

If she really wants to ""join the cause and protect earth"". tell her to get rid of humans because Animals did nothing wrong.

i know my opinions are all over the place but all of it points to 

extreme veganism like this, is really wrong and improves nothing|

break up

"she’s definitely lost her mind. it doesn’t seem like she’s carried this sort of attitude to anything else in the relationship but i might be cautious moving forward.    

as far as i know, her attitude towards Mittens is unprecedented for a vegan. you’ve already committed heavily to her lifestyle, and are doing your best with taking care of your cat (buying from reputable food sources, considering vegan options). you’ve taken strong steps for her, now it is time for her to do the same for you by allowing you to keep your beloved companion, at the cost of some mice and some possibly “cruel” food sourcing.    

on a personal note, the idea that a cat eating mice is “anti-vegan” is laughable. being against animal cruelty is one thing but being against *animals eating other animals in nature* is just...

"Listen bro. Listen! If she is like this at 7 months, think about how much worse it can get. For someone like this, the control and demands don’t let up the longer a relationship lasts... this is only the beginning. She’s testing you. It’s bad enough she didn’t tell you in the beginning but also that she alienated you from your affectionate cat, Mittens, in the first place. Imagine if she was like fine, Mittens can stay. What kind of torture would she put Mittens through just for being alive? Does she not understand that Mittens is also an animal? Vegans should love and respect all animals, not just omnivores. Look, it starts here with Mittens then it’s you can’t hang out with ‘that friend’, then she hates your mom or your sister so you talk to your family less and less.... 

Also check out other red duct threads where spouses have given away pets while the other was out of town or at work. I just read one a few days ago, a man’s wife took his dog to the pound and told him that he had run away. He found out 5 years later.

I think you should sit down with your girlfriend and tell her that you understand be here she is coming from but she’s taking it too far.

A bond between and animal and a person can be as pure as that of two humans. Don’t throw that bond away for a woman who is trying to control your life by her beliefs. I don’t believe in god. My girlfriend does. I have never given her the ultimatum of her parents throwing away the Bible VS us breaking up. She is taking advantage of your love for her to get you to conform to what she believes in. Part of that stems from you giving up your usual diet in the first place.

I hope you see why she didn't say anything about her problem with you having a cat before.  She is using the relationship you have now to manipulate you into giving up your cat. Because she knows that, after you two got serious, you'd think exactly how you said: ""an wonderful relationship could be ending because of a difference in ideology"". It was on purpose. Don't worry about ending things. From what you wrote about this relationship, it's the right thing to do.

"I had a 2-year relationship with a vegan dude who respected that I was my own person and that I sometimes ate meat and eggs. I have my own history with eating disorders and told him that I was not up for restricting my diet when that has led me down a slippery slope before; he totally respected that and that was the end of the conversation. He never chastised me or “playfully” gave me shit for not being vegan or having a dog just like I never gave him shit for his diet and ethics. I tried not to eat meat in front of him out of respect, but he always said he wasn’t upset by it and that I didn’t have to change my eating because of him. That, to me, is how a relationship between two people should go. Of course it’s nice that you were able to go from pescatarian to vegan because that was a big point for her, but it seems like she is forgetting that you are an autonomous person with your own beliefs, you are not an extension of her. It would be unhealthy to try and make you an extension rather than treat you as an individual whose differences she respects.

"First, Im sorry you’re going through this, it sucks to be put in this position.
I would agree with the others that this is not specifically about your cat.
Cats are obligated carnivores, they might nibble on some veggies but very rarely. Any sane vet would advise against a vegan diet as that would endanger the cat beyond repair. They eat meat, that’s their nature.
As you said, many vegans have cats because they understand that we all have different dietary needs. 
I was in a similar situation with someone that didn’t want a cat and I can say those were the saddest years of my life. Now that I am with someone that loves my cat just as much as me, I realize how much I missed having this in my life.

You and your girlfriend might have a lot in common but making you choose between her and Mittens is not ok, especially for the reasons that she’s invoking.
Mittens would need to eat meat regardless of who takes care of her. She doesn’t understand our ideologies and will not stop eating meat for the sake of saving animals because it needs them to stay alive.

Choose your cat! Mittens loves you and knows you as its main caregiver, you have been there for a big part of its life. At times cats can be more humans than many humans.
One day you will find someone that loves and accepts you both as much as you deserve.",2020-07-20 08:25:44,1,relationship_advice,Quingjao,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"Your girlfriend is an ardent vegan, but advocates for the extinction of animal species? And as a vegan, she believes that to lead a cruelty free lifestyle, you must abandon an already existing animal, who no matter what will still need to eat unless it is starved. 

That is *exactly* the same argument vegans make against slaughter houses; people don't want to kill animals, so they get someone else to do it for them. It is still them causing the indirect harm, and so by virtue of you *already having a cat* you have chosen to need to purchase meat for the rest of that cats existence. 

Again, it's similar to already owning leather shoes, or a watch, you aren't supposed to just bin them as if the animals life was meaningless, you should keep using them so they at least serve a purpose, you just wouldn't buy more.

"actually, the more vegan thing is keeping Mittens.

**Being vegan is about reducing harm as much as possible and practicable to animals.**

Mittens is an animal and therefore deserves the best home she can get, who better to make sure than the vegan themselves?

Also, since mittens already exists, you the owner can actually apply your vegan principles to pet keeping. Maybe switch mittens to a partially vegan diet, or an all organic/local farmed meats one, or supplement the food with cuttings that would normally be trown away. You can also put a bell on mittens to prevent her from catching other animals, or build a catio and keep her like that.

She's also the most environmentally friendly way to keep mice populations in check. She'll catch a few, and just being there deters from large populations of mice living under your roof.

If you ever have a mice problem, using poison it a very painful way to die for the mice, and possibly poisons other animals who eat them or the bait as well. So Mittens is the better option.

If you (hypothetically) would get rid of Mittens, there is no telling how the new owner would treat her, or what they would feed her.

"A few things.

1. The chances of this girl being your life long partner is slim. 

2. I bet your girlfriend is in love with PETA. Let me tell you. Fuck PETA. Outside cats are responsible for vast majority of birds dying. Close to extinction level responsibility of some birds is placed on free roaming cats. PETA pretty much believes no animal should come in contact with humans, a lot don't even think humans should help sick or injuries animals. PETAs one and only ""animal shelter"" has over a 90% kill rate of healthy animals bc they'd rather see animals dead then with humans. Send her those articles. Domesticated animals live happier and longer lives with humans than they do out in nature by themselves. 

3. The first year in a relationship is to find out if it'll work long term. This one doesn't sound like it's going to make it. You are young and will find other people who are a better fit for you and Mittens. Be glad you found out before lease papers were singed and she just got rid of your cat one day.",2020-07-20 08:04:02,1,relationship_advice,FluffyOwl30,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"I don't think it's about being vegan or not liking cats, your girlfriend is trying to control you. First she wants you to become vegan, now she is giving you an ultimatum over a pet that you've taken care of for 3 years. Mark my words, if you did allow this (don't think you will) she would take it up a notch and tell you what kind of car you should be driving, how you make your coffee, etc;

"So if I understand this right... She, who cares about animals so deeply, completely blindfolds herself to natural order of things, dietary requirements of animals and expects a well fed animal in a loving house to get ridden of, and still argues about animal rights? What's the limit to her behaviour? After cats will she go after every carnivorous animal just because they eat meat?

"I lost my ex wife to veganism. I did the same as you, changing diet and doing the best I could to accommodate and adopt. We were together 16 years, married for 5 and she'd just turned vegan after our wedding. 

It instantly started off on a bad foot. We eventually had no meat or dairy in the house and I'd only consume certain foods out of her sight (at work etc). The trouble was she would use literally anything as an excuse to bring up the subject and it went so far that I'd have to listen to screaming and crying fits every fucking night about factory farming. She'd throw her phone on my lap and shout ""this is the sound bacon makes when it's murdered"" as I arrived home after a long day and just wanted to watch Netflix.

I grew up as a fussy eater and had spent years trying to adjust my diet to something better than junk and soda, and was finally opening my mind to better foods. And I loved vegan food - it felt like an awakening for me. But she managed to alienate me from the subject by constant questioning, she wouldn't watch a program or read a book unless it was about veganism and She'd spend hours on her phone at night listening to the sounds of animals being killed. It was perverse and unnerving.

Then she got to a similar subject as here - she wanted to make our cat Merlin a vegan. She'd read all the online articles that said it was OK, when a cursory search online easily proved it was a bad idea. It was one more straw on the camels back.

It became so incredibly boring to be around her. I was shouldering all the bills and doing long hours while she built up her business as a hoilistic therapist. Then I had to come back to statements like ""medical testing on animals is bad and I don't care if humans all get cancer and die""

It was frankly relentless and depressing. So after 16 years and a whole lot of invested time, I bailed. Divorced, moved out and I took the fucking cat with me on the pretext that he needs to have a garden to roam around in. Until then he was a house cat (it was her decision to get him and I threw up a lot of arguments to not have a cat in a 2 bedroom flat without a garden. Unfortunately I succumbed to the charm offensive She'd got her mates to lay on me).

Of course I made a lot of mistakes in that relationship too. But it was her obsessive compulsive attitude towards veganism that made me realise we just were never going to be able to continue. 

That was over 2 years ago now and I'm so much happier with my girlfriend. Its like night and day. The funny thing was all her vegan mates were awesome people. We got along famously and never had this kind of awkwardness. My ex though, wow...she was too extreme by any reasonable standards.

Yet she still owns and plays the nice expensive ukulele she purchased with the fucking bone nut on the neck and the abalone (seashell) inlays. Fucking hypocrite.",2020-07-20 08:01:14,1,relationship_advice,FinalEdit,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

Secondly, your gf just sounds like a spoiled manipulating little brat. It sounds like every foreseeable argument you’ll ever have with her will be an “all or nothing” where YOU do what she wants or it’s over. You’re young! Cut your loses and move on!

We can think about not having pets after her if it really disturbs you, but the fact that she will be with someone else doesn't get rid of the fact that she will have to eat meat. Either you ask me to suppress her (which is a bit hypocritical for a vegan) or to pretend that the issue doesn't exist"".

Also, I have been vegan for nearly a decade and I learnt very quickly that you can't change people's morals for them. You can be an open book, lead by example, answer questions, and provide resources where appropriate, but as soon as you give people impossible choices or ram your morals down their throats, you cut people off. She's doing absolutely no good for reducing cruelty if that's her attitude.

Her argument to get rid of the cat is short sighted. I'd of probably understood cat is sentient being, but a cat doing what a cat does is no reason to get rid of them. Can't turn all of the predators on the planted vegan. It would destroy the eco system.

"I was a turbo vegan for nearly ten years and now I’m a carnivore again. I never thought I would ever eat meat or use animal products again. I was raw vegan at one point and made my own makeup. 

Cruelty free and veganism is a way of life but now matter how cruelty free, vegan, sweatshop free, or zero waste you are, you are hurting something or some cause. When I was the “purest” vegan, eating like rice and plants or any of these things, I was hurting the people who farmed that stuff. There’s probably an Asian person who gets paid pennies to gram rice for the brands I was buying. When I was not using any cruelty made products, I still had my iPhone and MacBook and tv which were probably made by children in sweatshops. 

When I bought second hand clothes, I had cool hippie scarves I got from indian shops that were again probably made for pennies. 

It’s easy being the purist, until you realize how futile it is. That isn’t the reason I gave up being vegan.

But as a vegan who was super strict and a super ethical warrior, I can tell you, she’s crazy and would give up and will fall deeper into the rabbit hole until she too sees the futility of it.

I had a cat too and had this conversation with an ex of mine who was also strict vegan.

"One of my veterinary nurse friends is one of those 'shouty' vegans. She has 2 cats that live happily on a meat based diet. She totally understands that cats can't live a vegan lifestyle because of their dietary needs. She would also NEVER advocate for something as far fetched as the extinction of domesticated cats because that's unbelievably fucking stupid on so many levels.

My dude, she already turned you into a vegan even though you were already struggling being pescatarean. She commented on disliking your cat and now she's got you well and truly wrapped around her finger, time for the kitty to go.

Congrats on going vegan if that's your life choice but I was always under the impression you are supposed to love people for who they are and how they are and not warp them into something that you find more pleasing.

Your girlfriend is a control freak and it won't end here. This is a red flag if ever there was one.

"Animals eat other animals.

As humans we have the cognitive abilities to choose to eat without killing, but cats are carnivores by nature and cannot make that decision. It is one thing to reduce human violence - it is another thing entirely to try and change the violent nature of nature itself. Even creatures as docile as deer are omnivores, and have been recorded crunching up baby birds when the opportunity presents itself.

To claim any species should go extinct because it harms other species is ridiculous and animal cruelty. Calling for the extinction of domestic housecats is advocating for the animal equivalent of genocide. Some animal rights activist your girlfriend turned out to be.

Personally, I would leave her. Not because the cat is more valuable than the girlfriend, but because she's making unreasonable demands and is seemingly unwilling to compromise.

"Reading your post it sounds to me as though your girlfriend just doesn’t particularly like cats and doesn’t want to live with one, so she’s using the vegan thing as her reasoning for expecting you to give up your cat, because she knows she sounds worse if she just says ‘I don’t like cats. Give up your cat.’ If she uses her morals and principles it sounds like she has good reason and gives her even more of a moral high ground. 

She also sounds demanding, self absorbed and uncompromising in expecting someone to give up their own beliefs and pleasures in life to ‘do as she says’. These are not qualities you would want in a partner you’re looking to settle down with anyway. In the future she decides she wants to move but you don’t... she’s going to demand it. She decides she doesn’t want kids but you do... guess who’s going to win that argument? You need someone who will listen and compromise in a solution together that suits both parties and if she isn’t willing to do that over something as big as your already-owned and loved pet, she isn’t going to do it about small, petty everyday stuff and you’re going to be hen-pecked, miserable and spending your life doing as you’re told!",2020-07-20 08:42:38,1,relationship_advice,malfie44,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

If she fails to understand this or make a compromise for you, and chooses her veganism over your relationship, that should be a definite sign to end things with her.",2020-07-20 08:50:10,1,relationship_advice,niatanami,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"You've been with your cat longer. It'd be even more cruel to give up your cat when he/she knows you and is comfortable with you than it is to own a domesticated cat. 

Oh, and your GF (hopefully soon to be ex) realizes how nature works right? Cats are naturally carnivores, and it's natural for them to eat other animals.",2020-07-20 08:50:09,1,relationship_advice,Not_A_Rebel_Spy,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat
"I'm just gonna come out and say it but, it's probably not about the cat. This woman is trying to force you to get rid of something you love, a family member. Shes either totally apathetic and emotionless, or she is genuinely trying to cause you harm and control you. Using shock value as well saying cats should be culled is incredibly insensitive to someone who owns a cat. This person puts their questionable beliefs before the feelings of those close to her. That is not a person you want to be with. Right now it will be the cat, later on down the line, it will be friends, family and hobbies. You will dodge a bullet with this one, OP. Dont think of it as losing a whole relationship over a cat. Think of it as her exposing her true colours before it was too late. Just because you spent alot of time with someone doesn't mean they wouldn't hurt or abuse you. It might not be on purpose but just actions based on emotional instability, trying to prove you will love her over anything else because insecurity and abandonment issues, often a BPD or other mental illness trait. Notice how this all happened after a significant amount of time spent together. The sweetness stage is over, now it's the control and abuse stage. This is typical of people with abuse and control issues. She has no concern or value for the things in your life that make you happy and that is a major red flag. If she doesn't care about your cat, she doesn't care about you, OP. And honestly I dont trust people that dont like animals, and even more so if they're vegan. Their principles are just virtue signalling, not from a genuine place of love for animals. Be careful around people that show apathy and strong beliefs. She sounds a bit like an onision type, and you really dont wanna date onision.

 I had a friend who had a friend with a similar pro vegan apathetic person, and she started taking my friends cats saying she was going to look after them and then told her she drowned them in the washing machine, just so she could make my friend feel bad. People who dont like animals are no friends of mine.",2020-07-20 08:49:54,1,relationship_advice,,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"Assuming this is real, cats before partners, imo!

Also I find it weird if she is vegan to be cruelty free ""for the animals"" yet she doesn't hesitate to get rid of an animal for her own comfort? She doesn't have the brain to think that a cat does not have the intellect to even start pondering morality (a human concept)? 

I've never personally met a vegan like this. My vegan friends have carnivorous pets and understand that's their nature.

anyway, again, good on you to keep Mittens. mittens deserves better, and obviously don't put Mittens on a diet not advised by the vet.

This is not something you can compromise on. I think your friends are either right and she's looking for an excuse, or she is just not the right person for your.

"You know what? I am, I would say, 90 percent Vegan (though I don't even like to use that label anymore... sigh...) and I think your girlfriend is totally crazy and her arguments nonsensical. Just because she lives a vegan lifestyle, she is not perfect and has no right demanding ""perfection"" (or whatever this is, in her eyes) from others. 

Does she own a Macbook or other laptop? A smartphone? Well, guess what: parts of those are sourced through child labor sadly! So, by her standards of being a 100 percent cruelty-free person, she should have to get rid of those. 

To me, being plant-based or vegan or whatever you wanna call it means, that I do my best, every day, but I am far from perfect. I also still own used leather products and to be quite honest, I am not sure it would economically be more responsible to throw those away and buy products made from synthetic materials that will forever pollute our oceans and planet. Yes, leather is made from animals that often have been killed in a horrible way, yet, synthetic materials also kill our marine life and landfills are overflowing! So, can I really say, one way is better...? I'm not sure. Which is why I strive to do my best, as per my own inner conscience, and allow other people to do the same. My way is not the perfect way or the only way. It is arrogant to be so narrow minded and fanatic, that you think you can spit on other people's choices and demand ""better"" from them LOL.

I would say, keep Mittens and find a girlfriend who's views on life are not as narrow minded and fanatic as your current girlfriends. She will police you around for the rest of your life otherwise, and you will never feel like you can actually just be yourself and make your own choices.

That isn't a compromise. It's an ultimatum. A compromise is like one person doing the cooking and the other washing up. This is an afront to human decency. If you are ""compromising"" this much now, imagine watch the next thing will be. Your diet and your pet in under a year.. Wow.

It is natural for them to hunt and eat meat . I don’t understand how your gf would think it would be unnatural , because it is part of the ecosystem and well.. they are animals .

Break up with her. A true animal lover wants what’s best for the animals. As humans we are able to go meatless but cats are designed to eat meat.

"One of the first rules of dating mate is don't date someone who demands that you change yourself to become ""potential"" for them. If you set out on that footing, you risk always being forced to change as and when issues arise, while they stay the same. A potential partner either accepts you as you are or you keep on walking, sure there's compromise to be had but thats when both of you change, not just you.

I'm vegan, husband and kids are not. I respect that and do most of the cooking  I just don't eat what they do. I also have 2 cats and 2 dogs, all none vegan. I don't expect any of them to change to meet my ideals, probably why I've been with my dh for 19 years.

Your gfs views are extreme and they are her own, yet she is demanding you conform  to them, as she did with your diet, while she makes no such compromise. To discriminate against an animal for its natural behaviour is bloody absurd and naive in the extreme, as the whole world revolves around the predator prey dynamic and without it we'd never have made it put of the primordial soup.

So kill cats because they eat meat? How does that make sense? Are you allowed to be around people who eat meat or is she advocating for the extinction of them too? She sounds like a crazy person. Needs meds and lots of therapy before she does something really bad crazy. NTA.

"So, she doesn't think it's right to own a cat because vegans are against cat ownership? And then to link to a post about how exterminating all domestic cats would be better, instead?

Domestic cats serve a variety of functions, including companionship and pest control. Ultimately, they are useful; and it's often better if they're in a home versus on the street (for a variety of reasons). Further, not all vegans agree with your girlfriend; there's something to be said about rescuing an animal from a shelter or an unsafe environment. As an example, we have some domesticated (but semi-feral) cats in my neighborhood. They kill doves, which is an invasive species for my region (them dying is a good thing). If anything, the local ecology benefits from the presence of these cats, even if it does mean that sometimes I'll find a lot of feathers in my yard.

Honestly? Your girlfriend shouldn't have an issue with you owning Mittens. You had Mittens from the start of your relationship. She knew all about her from the start, and it makes me wonder if she thought she could talk you into rehoming Mittens as your relationship progressed. If she did not feel comfortable with you owning a cat, she should have mentioned it previously. I'd start by asking why she didn't share how she felt earlier. Her answers can help you decide how to move forward. She's effectively asking you for an ultimatum; to choose between Mittens or her. If this was such a huge deal-breaker for her, why not share her thoughts on it with you from the very beginning?",2020-07-20 08:36:22,1,relationship_advice,Niorlan,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

"As a vegan, 95% of the vegans I know (myself included) respect the fact the that CATS ARE CARNIVORES. They eat meat, that is the circle of life. We are omnivores and can survive off of plant based diets. We would be abusing carnivores if we forced them into a plant based diet which actually goes against veganism—forcing a choice on another animal. 

Many vegans I know support cats being carnivores because cats have to eat meat to live and live healthy. We aren’t uncomfortable with this fact because it’s life, it’s biology. 

Some vegans do not believe in keeping pets, however realistically we are past that. Pets have been domesticated over 100s of years. If we don’t take them in and give them the best possible life, they die in a pound or on the street.

I’m sorry you are going through this and if your girlfriend is going to be this crazy about her veganism, keep your cat and live a happy life.",2020-07-20 08:34:16,1,relationship_advice,OMG_A_Thing,comment,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat

This is great news. I switched to vegetarianism 9 years ago and am now trying to make the leap to Veganism. What I think is great about this is it allows people who enjoy meat to still eat something very similar to meat. The odd thing is I have no interest in trying it because after 9 years I don’t really remember how meat tasted or have any desire to eat it. But this a great step in the Animal Liberation movement.

**But does it taste like meat?**

Let me preface this with I have had quite a lot of fake meat because I enjoy food.   I realized a while ago if I am willing to try most things, then there isn't a reason to hate vegan food.

**The real honest answer of does it taste like real meat is both yes and no.**

Purely from a visual and texture standpoint, it is pretty damn close.  You probably wouldn't notice unless you were explicitly told.  I have had a lot of meat and fake meat, especially the fakes that people have claimed bullshit lies that it tastes the same when it doesn't by a long shot.  Texture wise this is as close as you can get.

Taste wise?  Ehhhh... lets start with saying that it tastes good.  It has a meaty flavor and juiciness, *but* it it also tastes like the chef went a little crazy with the spices. 

 In other words, if someone gave you a regular burger, and an impossible burger, and you knew one was real and the other was not, you could distinguish between the two.  However, if you just happened to order a burger and were given the Impossible Burger, I could see how you might think it's real, just with some weird spices and flavoring.",2019-09-19 20:08:48,2,Futurology,,comment,Impossible Burgers are hitting their first grocery stores tomorrow - the plant-based burger plans to reach every region of the US by the middle of next year.

"Hey guys, had to show some science. Remember y'all it's industry and transportation that cause more green house damage than meat. [https://www.fb.org/market-intel/agriculture-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions](https://www.fb.org/market-intel/agriculture-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions) from the farm bureau. 

Ruminant animals are only 3.5-4 percent out of 9 percent of agriculture contributions. Also it's better to recycle the land using ruminant animals to keep soil stronger. All the South African farms that were burnt down and had their animals wiped out will never see that land come back to life in their lifetime. 

Also  I've seen things that the feed for cows and pigs is corn, but all the corn and soy is not fit for human consumption and that is why it is given to them for . The good corn and soy we keep and ship out. We have to factor population and ease of processed foods. California has so many people in it, wish that we could commute and pollute less. Also we have so many other crops we literally do not need like almonds (1 gallon per nut yo) and other above ground crops that I think are resources are wasted on.

I like the flavor of meat (hell, I just posted about a plate of bbq that blew my mind), but also have a not inconsiderable amount of guilt about eating it, since the conditions the animals live in in factory farms are deplorable and, if you handed me a gun and said ""go get your beef, you have no other choice if you ever want to eat meat again"" I'd go veg reeeeeeeeal quick. On the other hand, my wife has no misgivings about eating meat, can not stand a normal vegetarian diet and it's too expensive to buy two sets of groceries so that I can feel better about myself.

BUT, she loves Impossible Burgers and has stated that, if it was more available, did as well replacing other protein types and was as affordable as meat products she would have no issue switching to a vegetarian diet. I hope they really lean into it, take off and become a normal thing, because not being yoked with meat-guilt is deffo a life goal that I thought wasn't attainable without winning the lottery.",2019-09-19 18:46:53,2,Futurology,mfwank,comment,Impossible Burgers are hitting their first grocery stores tomorrow - the plant-based burger plans to reach every region of the US by the middle of next year.

"I'm a vegetarian and I don't eat all this processed vegetarian and vegan bullshit. No fake meats, no fake cheese, if you want to eat that stuff then just fucking eat it. The fake stuff will never be as good and processing it to come close isn't good for you either.

In America I hate how the vegetarian option is usually some processed veggie burger or some shitty salad with a processed or sugar infused salad dressing. Why can't we just take a page from other countries. Mexicans will load you up on beans and rice, Middle Eastern will load you up on hummus, Chickpeas, eggplant, Fava beans, and lentils. Asians will go stir fried rice and vegetables (the sauce isn't great for you but meh). Indians got vegetarian food down to a science so I mostly cook Indian at home.

But seriously, why do we need our vegetarian food to be fake meat? Are we just so fucking meat obsessed that even when you stop eating meat you have to pretend to eat it anyways?",2019-09-20 04:07:42,1,Futurology,NimbleAlbatross,comment,Impossible Burgers are hitting their first grocery stores tomorrow - the plant-based burger plans to reach every region of the US by the middle of next year.

"Hey what's up. Hope you had/have a great day. Sorry I'm from Germany and also to lazy to check every comment, so forgive me if I say something what somebody said already. First: I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I don't try to live like that, I prefer regional meat and food if it's available but I don't try hard on that of ""reasons""(I'll go back later to the reasons). We have vegan stuff in supermarkets (most of them i guess (sorry again, cause I don't watch for it actively)). But back to what I wanted to say...seems like this thing is like a big thing in ""this"" context(I mean all over the U.S. next year...wtf, cool). If products like that with a big company behind with I could trust would be available for a payable price in a good position(so I can find them and not have to ask were it is every time), there would be no doubt that I would buy it instead of animal products. If it's tastes good BTW. I also want to tell you a bit about back in the days, not even my grandparents told me that also my parents. It was usual not to eat meat every day or second, it was like a ""sunday"" or ""celebration"" thing. But long story short...most people just should look out for what theyr food schedule looks like and if it's good for them and the planet(transport, cooling, etc. ...sorry I know that a lot of people don't get what's behind of ""eating stuff from 4000miles away"" and I expect stupid comments :P)...so let's come to a end finally. Eat what you like and makes you feel good but think about it, think about what chain is on it and if it's a special thing or should it be. Sometimes it's better to enjoy the little things and keep them little so you can enjoy them big if they're happen. Sorry for my awful English. Have a great time.

"i do want to say that its incredible easy to make your own veggie patty. 

i make a veggie+chicken patty with cucumbers, bell peppers, zucchini, spinach, onions, carrots etc, whatever veggies are about to go bad. i chop them in a grinder, and chop my chicken in a grinder. then i mush them together with breadcrumbs. this way i eat less chicken, but still get a good amount of protein in and my patty doesnt taste strictly like veggies, and still get the chicken taste.

im assuming you could do the same with beef. also i dont even add much salt into my patty but load up on mint, cayenne, paprika, garlic etc for taste. then i make sure to only oil/spray the part where im going to grill or pan fry my patty.

this would be the healthiest, yummiest, budget friendly and eco-friendly way to get a meat tasting patty. i know the objective is to go completly plant based patty, but if you want the beef/chicken taste, you can do a 1:1 meat ratio or even less meat.",2019-09-20 00:19:20,1,Futurology,bakedlayz,comment,Impossible Burgers are hitting their first grocery stores tomorrow - the plant-based burger plans to reach every region of the US by the middle of next year.

"At the moment the plant based alternatives are pretty null and void for the people such as myself who really like their meat and feel, taste wise they just don't measure up. That's not to say that in the future, they won't catch up, but I think the real gains are going to come from lab grown and synthetic meat. Lab made Dairy has already hit the market and lab grown meat already exists and will likely hit shelves sometime during the 2020s. I think that eventually lab grown meat and dairy production will for practical reason take up a much larger share of production and consumption when they become cheaper to sell and produce, particularly since consumers won't be able to tell the difference taste wise.

At the moment the biggest barrier for lab grown meat is production costs, which are falling rapidly, but still too high for regular consumers and pending regulatory approval.",2019-09-19 17:47:54,1,Futurology,Godzilla52,comment,Impossible Burgers are hitting their first grocery stores tomorrow - the plant-based burger plans to reach every region of the US by the middle of next year.

"This stuff is good, but the price is still not at a level where it could be competitive with meat.  I've been vegetarian for 20 years and I'm excited about the hype of this lately.  However, things like this have happened in the past and failed.  Granted, it is a bit more hyped this time around, but there are flaws in the way it's being implemented.  The meat-substitute industry needs to stop advertising to health food enthusiasts and hipsters, and start aggressively advertising towards low-income families and normal millennials. They've started to, but haven't done enough.  If they can lower the cost below the price of ground beef patties, we could see a big change in how we eat protein as a society.  Example; The Impossible Whopper meal costs more than the Whopper meal.

"Rejoice slaves !!!

For the hour of your 'redemption' is nigh at hand !

Once the oil billionaires and smoke merchants have finished toppling the ecology of this world and starvation covers the land from crop failure, the remaining slaves (all of you who aren't fabulously wealthy - i.e. all of you) will be allowed rations of synthetic goo... but only after fulfilling the whims of the masters. To revamp an old phrase - ""no workee, no eatee"".

The wealthy have had the peasant class digging up the planet so they could sell it back to the peasants for roughly  20,000 years now. And regardless what you may think of your current station in life or what your bank account may lead you to believe; you are not wealthy. 

Your and my planet. ""They"" own it somehow. And we let them for myriad reasons. And now it's time for it to be just their planet.

Come to find out they're soaked up as much wealth as they're able without sliding over the edge with the rest of us and so have moved on to newly thawed virgin soil and clean water while they leave the rest of us to fight over the bones they dropped on the floor. Once the wealthy are safely situated away from us unwashed masses and after the death match for the remaining food and water, the paltry remaining few will be allowed sustenance as long as the work quotas are filled and the masters are happy. ish.

The wealthy will then be able to sit back, play and enjoy the fruits of THEIR Earth... You didn't really believe all that bullshit they wrote about ""the rich man can't get into heaven"" and ""the meek will inherita the earth"", or any of that other crap they wrote when they fabricated THAT book too, did you?

""You'll get everything you ever wanted and things will be perfect.... but only if you do EXACTLY as I tell you to do... oh, and you'll get all this neat stuff only after you die.""

Thyne day is upon us, oh noble seekers of the apocalyptic Earth.

"I'm really hyped for lab-grown meat just for the sci-fi aspect, but I'm also interested in using it as a more sustainable source of protein. However, it seems like all the current lab-grown meats still require a growth medium made from fetal bovine calfs (possibly abbreviated FBS--fetal bovine serum??), which is currently a byproduct of the dairy industry ?aborting? calves as part of the system of constant pregnancy for dairy cows to continue producing milk. So you still need to raise/feed/etc. a lot of cattle for this process, on the whole.

I understand that it's difficult to grow meat without fetal bovine material because it's used to stop the cells from ""realizing"" that they're reproducing in a way they weren't intended to.

"12 oz for $9, compared to 16oz for $3 for traditional ground beef (based on prices in my local grocer).

The way I see it, everyone has a price point where they are willing to switch over to plant-based beef. For a large portion, its when it matches or beats ground beef. Although I think that some people who claim that will break as the price slowly falls (hopefully).

For me, I know that its somewhere under $3/patty, because that's how much Beyond burgers were at my grocery store. But its close, to the point where if I might get a pack if it ever goes on sale.

 - hunters

Neither grocery store meats nor any meat substitute comes close to matching the quality and flavor of humanely harvested and ethically processed wild game like venison or elk. It’s hard to beat a steak or stew or burger or sausage that I’ve personally and carefully prepared from field to fork.  When this is not possible,  I eat less meat or choose my source carefully. If I do not trust my source/butcher quality and wanted a healthy substitute, then sure, I’ll happily reach for Impossible Burger instead of some questionable beef at Walmart or wherever - especially if it’s in one of those carbon monoxide filled bubble packs designed to keep meat looking artificially bright red.",2019-09-20 07:31:43,0,Futurology,,comment,Impossible Burgers are hitting their first grocery stores tomorrow - the plant-based burger plans to reach every region of the US by the middle of next year.

"It won't taste the same. That's all marketing hype and it never pans out. 

A few decades ago McDonald's changed the oil it cooked its french fries in from beef tallow to a vegetable-based oil. They wanted to use a healthier oil for PR reasons and presented the new cooking oil as an equivalent substitute, but it isn't the same. People today don't remember what the fries used to taste like, so a group of food scientists recently got the original recipe and recreated the beef tallow-based fries, and the taste testers were amazed by how much better it tasted. Like a forgotten language, memories of how the fries used to taste had faded into obscurity.

"Last week I ate an Impossible Burger.  If I did not know in advance the patty was entirely plant based, I would never have suspected I wasn't eating meat.  The only negative comment I had was it looked like a frozen pre-made meat patty, rather than fresh rolled ground beef that the place uses in their other burgers.  Everything else was surprisingly spot on and it didn't cost much more than their normal burgers.  Once the price comes down and you can buy it in stores, I'll have no objection to buying it instead of real ground beef.

I can buy 2 steaks of the same cut. One from the discount supermarket and the other from my local family owned butcher. Though on face value they are very similar pieces of meat, the flavour and texture of each, even when prepared identically, will be drastically different.

I just don't think that a synthetic process is going to be able to replicate whatever intrinsic factors define the difference between the $30/kg steak from the $12/kg steak. Like, this may represent a great way to produce cheap, low class meat. Assuming that the process can be economised to the point that it is cheaper than raising a beast, and let's be honest, once the process is farmed out to 3rd world sweat shops (sidebar: would that make them 'blood, sweat and tears'-shops?), the process would have to scale economically.

But I just don't see the type of person that will pay for $50/kg wagyu at a premium butcher, or sit down to a $80 steak in a high end restaurant, happily switching to 'test tube tartar' or 'petri dish porterhouse'.

"Legit concerns with this idea. Not the artificial meat, that's fine. Nor the fact that he's probably being overly optimistic, that's a minor issue. But the fact that he said we'd no longer have to kill any animals.

Let's be optimistic and say that we will have enough of this artificial meat to feed everyone who possibly needed or wanted to eat it. What then, do we do with all the livestock that we've cultivated to the point that they're unable to survive in the wild? Do we have a gigantic BBQ and cook up all the livestock that we won't be sending to zoos? Should we keep all varieties of the animals that we have raised to be our food stocks, or only some? Do we still keep animals for eggs and milk as well, or will that be replaced with artificial substitutes as well?

But more importantly, because I'm seeing a lot of people who don't understand how the food chain work recently, are we going to be completely removing the idea of conservationist killing? We as a species are at the top of the food chain, for good or for evil. We have done research into how this food chain works to sustain the environment we're in. And a lot of times, that involves killing. This is a subject that is so anathema to the way that any typical vegan thinks, but is very important to consider. 

So to recap, I'm very much for having lab grown meat available for people who need and want it. But I'm concerned that the ideas that it promotes, mainly that killing animals is a bad thing.

"I have the same thought everytime I read stuff about ""manufactured meat"".  Believe me I know that in many lifetimes this will not happen so it's basically hypothetical.  If all meat was ""clean"" and there were no longer the need for the large population of animals that exist purely for consumption.  Is it better for those animals to live solely to end up being eaten? Or is it better for them not to exist at all?

Granted again I will never in my lifetime have to see a world like this exist and generations beyond me won't likely see it either.  But there are plenty of farms that treat their animals better than what everyone has seen in all of those ""scary"" documentaries.  I personally don't think that you're saving cows by coming up with reasons for them not to exist.  Again hypothetical... But live and be eaten? Or not live at all?

Honestly, the hardest thing about not eating animal products is avoiding telling people that I don't eat animal products. You'd be surprised at how often it comes up, especially at work.  It always makes me really uncomfortable because it really seems to cause cognitive dissonance in others. It always seems like their reaction, without saying it, is ""oh you don't eat meat? so you think you're better than me?"" I quit eating meat for equal parts anti-cruelty and health reasons, but I'm not at all the type to wear it as a badge or incorporate it into my personality.

> 
> I believe that in 30 years or so we will no longer need to kill any animals and that all meat will either be clean or plant-based, taste the same and also be much healthier for everyone - Richard Branson
> 
> Whether it was the 'got milk' campaign that had celebrities touting the 'benefits' of dairy, or Bill Cosby selling the 'deliciousness' of Jello, the proof is in the pudding that influencers hold immense power over our decisions at the grocery store. It's with this understanding that I couldn't ignore the potential impact of Richard Branson's recent article on Virgin's website predicting that animals will be removed from our food system in a few decades.
> 
> Branson is among a growing number of very wealthy and influential investors that envision a very different food system than we have now. They recognize that our diets are unsustainable, and that changes are coming whether we like it or not, so might as well get on board sooner than later. Which is why they're backing companies that promise to tantalize our taste buds while removing animals from the equation.

> 
> Branson and Gates are among many powerful investors reshaping our food system by reducing our reliance on animal protein. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg
> 
> Both Branson and Bill Gates, alongside 'smart money' folks like Cargill and Kimball Musk recently backed the clean-meat company Memphis Meats in their $17 million Series A round, joining a string of sustainable food companies that have raised an impressive amount of capital in recent years. Some might argue that Branson is simply 'talking his book,' making bold proclamations to support his investments. Given his decision to give up eating meat back in 2014, I'd argue that he's simply aligning his money with his beliefs, which stem from the impact that animal agriculture has on our environment via deforestation, which is accelerating the planet-destroying effects of climate change.
> 
> Winston Churchill made a similarly bold prediction back in the 1930's. Given the incredible progress we're witnessing from companies like Mosa Meat, Hampton Creek, and Finless Foods, it's possible that Branson's sky-high prediction will land on time.

"Wrong wrong wrong. If we do not consume animals the herds will go through raging starvation( sped up by wildfires, resource competition from other species, drought, floods and a lack of profitable management systems), death from compromised immune systems not having enough nutrition, resulting in dwindling numbers that natural predators will decimate bu targetting the newborns and young. Which dictates we need to continue selectively harvesting individuals for hunting or industrial slaughter. If we practice management programs but don't consume the meat then we are simply killing an animal and create ethical and hygienic problems throughout our society. 

Cattle, goats, pork and chicken aren't dwindling. Horse ownership is, immediately following bans on horse slaughter for dog and cat food, let alone human consumption. Every species that has been endangered and been re-established has almost always come from for profit controlled hunting programs or an end market. I.e. Buffalo meat become a common source of protein following a marketing and sales campaign

Every species that has not been taken off the list is banned from hunting, resulting in less people able to appreciate and learn the requirements for the species survival and remove infected or poor genes. 

There is not one commodity that is respected which is not utilized to its full potential. This mentality will ruin our food industry, harm the species health and ultimately decrease the appreciation of a naturally renewable commodity

1 cow + 1 bull = 7 cattle throughout the females entire lifespan. Hence why we have feeder cattle ( fatted for consumption) breeding heifers and breeding bulls. 

Richard Branson is probably a swell guy, but don't preach animal and range management from the concrete jungle. Those of us that supply our food and energy nationally are able and should practice humane practices, talk with us but don't believe for a minute that theories from people who have not experienced the industrial aspects of this business know what they are talking about. 

I don't second guess my doctor, and I hate the paperwork and redundancy that comes from government intervention. Many of you have your own experiences where politicians and voters who know nothing of your job have created more problems than solutions.  Why would you trust the people who have ruined healthcare, lowered our international academic standing, annoyed our trade partners and emboldened out enemies with 'safely' controlling your food?",2017-09-28 00:19:10,0,Futurology,kalaxiandelights,comment,"Richard Branson: ""I believe that in 30 years or so we will no longer need to kill any animals and that all meat will either be clean or plant-based, taste the same and also be much healthier for everyone."""

" If factory grown meat was popular enough that people all over the world were eating it, it would have to have some pretty cheap and easy process for making it. It would have to be as available as wheat. 

This either isn't going to happen, or if it does happen its going to completely change the way we live. 

No longer relying on having to kill things to survive would be a huge spiritual shift. 

There would be a lot more people out there in groups like PETA. 

There would be increasing animosity toward hunters. 

Factory farming of chickens and cattle and pigs would become unsustainable. 

The farms would close. Millions of cows and pigs and chickens would be suddenly among us.  There would be a call to kill all of the extra animals. It would probably happen.

""We report the case of a 7 month-old girl that presented with acute anemia, generalized muscular hypotonia and failure to thrive. Laboratory evaluation revealed cobalamin deficiency, due to a vegan diet of the mother.""
 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18293883
 
Most recent studies using more sensitive techniques for detecting B12 deficiency have found that 68% of vegetarians and 83% of vegans are B12 deficient, compared to just 5% of omnivores. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12816782

On paper, calcium intake is similar in vegetarians and omnivores (probably because both eat dairy products), but is much lower in vegans, who are often deficient.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21139125
http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/70/3/543s.full
 
Vegetarians and omnivores have similar levels of serum iron, but levels of ferritin—the long-term storage form of iron—are lower in vegetarians than in omnivores.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871479
 
Fruits and Vegetables
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12064344
 
This is significant, because ferritin depletion is the first stage of iron deficiency. Moreover, although vegetarians often have similar iron intakes to omnivores on paper, it is more common for vegetarians (and particularly vegans) to be iron deficient. For example, this study of 75 vegan women in Germany found that 40% of them were iron deficient, despite average iron intakes that were above the recommended daily allowance.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14988640
http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long
 
many plant foods that contain zinc also contain phytate, which inhibits zinc absorption. Vegetarian diets tend to reduce zinc absorption by about 35% compared with omniovorous diet.
http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long
 
Thus, even when the diet meets or exceeds the RDA for zinc, deficiency may still occur. One study suggested that vegetarians may require up to 50% more zinc than omnivores for this reason.

"The word meat should not be used, this is processed slop.  How on earth can somebody look at this and think this is healthy.  The list of ingredients in these processed shit patties is unreal.

At-a-glance
Impossible Foods’ meatless burger is marketed as a healthy and environmentally responsible choice.
The key ingredient that gives the Impossible Burger its meaty taste and makes it bleed like meat when cut is soy leghemoglobin (SLH), derived from genetically engineered yeast.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to sign off on the safety of SLH, which has never been in the human food supply before.
The FDA is also concerned that SLH may be an allergen.
The Impossible Burger contains a number of other ingredients that are derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
Some ingredients in the Burger are highly processed and are produced in industrial vats (“fermentation”).
The GM yeast must be grown in a nutrient-rich broth made of chemically synthesized ingredients that are themselves industrially manufactured.
Overall, the manufacturing processes for the Impossible Burger are materials-hungry and energy-hungry. These facts are being ignored in promotional claims about the environmental impact of the Burger.
The Impossible Burger represents the opposite of what today’s health-aware and environmentally conscious consumers want from their food: pure, natural, non-GMO ingredients that are transparently sourced.",2019-07-07 22:33:02,1,Futurology,BushPigOfDickDoom,comment,"Plant-Based Meat Is About to Get Cheaper Than Animal Flesh, Report Says"

Will definitely try it in the future and withhold judgement until then, but the prices atm (and I know it’s going to get cheaper before people say anything) are insane.

Prices as follows for The alternative Meat Co ( a plant based meat company) some prices are rounded up or down for flat numbers but nothing more than 40c.

https://shop.coles.com.au/a/a-vic-metro-richmond-south/product/coles-beef-mince-3-star-8850188p

So yeah not feasible for me to pay that much but when it gets cheaper here I will definitely buy some and decide what my thoughts are then.

All the meat products I’ve listed are things I actually buy and consume so I am aware there are more expensive options for better quality meat available however I don’t buy them.

In all honesty should probable add that I live a very active lifestyle and I’m much larger than the average person and as such eat a lot more food than most people.

"Going against the futurology gospel.

What a loaded title. Plant based **MEAT**, and Animal **FLESH**. The flippant PC rebranding of animal meat to promote these experimental products corrupts the conversation about these technologies and products.

I get the wondrous nature of masquerading plants as animal meat substitutes, but plant based **SUBSTITUTES** are still highly processed expensive food products in their infancy, and who knows the biological ramifications. 

These are corporations using the same political tools and marketing methods as the industry with vilifying fat over the past few decades.The promotion of margarine over butter as a healthier substitute has had profoundly negative effects on North American diets and people. Who's to say these **plant substitutes** wont have the same outcome.

We've as a species have achieved what we have with meat based diets and to muck with that equation seems reckless and short sighted.

"All ""plant based"" protein sources from the store I've tried taste like shit. Every single one.

While I could cook vegan/vegetarian meals from scratch, the variety of reasonably easy to cook protein just sucks. I do not like tofu, I do not like soy, I do not like anything you get from the ""meat substitute aisle"".

I could spend hours in the kitchen making all kinds of sauces etc. so that the vegan/vegetarian options are even edible, but in the end actual meat is the best ""effort to taste"" ratio that vegan and vegetarian foods can't even get close to.

I've tried vegan/vegetarian food in restauraunts too and while there are a lot of decent dishes, the variety is negligible and usually the tasty meals have a serious lack of protein.

Plant based meat can get as cheap as it wants, unless it really tastes good it doesn't matter. It also doesn't matter if I can't buy it in the store for a reasonable price to fulfill my daily protein needs.

"Yeah, no it's not. The click-bait headline says ""is about to"" meaning it is guaranteed to happen and will imminently happen, but then the 1st line of the article says ""Vegan meat **may** soon become cheaper"" meaning it is purely speculative and uncertain.

The article is based on the unexpert opinions of Liz Specht, PhD, a biologist, who says things like:
>companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are currently charging as much as the market will bear in order to funnel profits into expanding production capacity to meet surging demand. “Lowering prices would just lower their revenue, which would, in turn, hurt their ability to scale and meet demand,” Specht said. 

Wrong. Beyond/Impossible, like all startups trying to expand at breakneck speed, does so based on DEBT (or for beyond, the IPO), but then again I wouldn't expect Liz Specht to know that since she knows nothing about economics.

So right off the bat, we have a biologist who doesn't know how business works, speculating that Beyond/Impossible are charging sky-high prices to fund expansion, which is laughable, stupid, naive, and basically just shows that Liz Specht needs to stay in her lane. 

Anyone who knows anything about business and economics would know that you can easily look up the profit margins of any public company like Beyond. Their gross margin is 26.8%. You might say WOW, THAT'S SO HIGH! Nope. It's actually pretty low. Compare it to McDonalds, an old school ""non disruptor"", which has a gross margin of 51.18%.

So right off the bat, I'm just lines into the article, and I've already established that the article is based on stupid assumptions from a biologist who doesn't know what she's talking about.

>“There are major and minor elements of the manufacturing facility and production process design that make sense only for production volumes 10-fold or 100-fold larger than the capacity of the existing plant-based meat facilities, and these changes can facilitate radical increases in efficiency and thus decreases in cost,” Specht said. 

Uhh, I'm aware that economies of scale exist, but I don't trust Specht to be able to name a single ""element"" that only makes sense at 10-100x production, that would cause a ""radical"" decrease in cost. Just like the rest of the article, I think Specht is speculating and engaging in wishful thinking. I don't think she knows what she is talking about.

The truth is that economies of scale are no guarantee. Not everything scales up to be much cheaper at higher volumes, and to be honest, highly processed plant protein strikes me as exactly the kind of thing that would NOT benefit much from economies of scale. 
> Lastly, since many new vegan companies are funded by venture capital with the expectation of creating novel technologies, early funds are often used for research and development purposes, a cost that is passed onto the consumer initially but is reduced greatly as the new technology is scaled.

Again, Beyond has to publish what it spends on R&D now, and it spends very little. So chalk up another ignorant assumption from Liz Specht, biologist.",2019-07-07 18:24:53,1,Futurology,dekachin5,comment,"Plant-Based Meat Is About to Get Cheaper Than Animal Flesh, Report Says"

"Does anyone actually think this is healthier for them than meat and why do you think that?

Are there any carbon footprint studies on fake meat vs real meat? My meat stays within 50 miles of my home from farm to plate.  No way this processed garbage can touch that.

&#x200B;

I'm personally in the camp that this is processed garbage food with big money corporations pushing it as healthy and good for the planet because its not meat but from what I have read I would say they are wrong.

If its the cholesterol you're worried about going up, maybe you shouldn't be?  There is currently data taken from the NHANES database showing a higher LDL cholesterol (apparently the bad one to some people) is actually correlated to living longer. Check out Dave Feldman who has done some good work imo on this topic.

"Unpopular Opinion:

Eating meat is what humans are supposed to do, and being ‘eco-friendly’ about ranching beef by developing plant-based ‘meats’ may do long-term harm to the human body.


I say this with the idea in mind that the mantra ‘you are what you eat’ applies. Obviously it isn’t meant to be literal, seeing as how nobody will become patty melts after eating one, but eating meat keeps you in the food chain (on top of it, to be clear). 

As you eat the animals around you, you become the highest in the pecking order. While some may not take my opinion seriously, and everyone has that right, I do think that treating ourselves like inferior animals (by not consuming the others), will over time make us into legitimately inferior animals, a la the ‘you are what you eat’ mantra.

"The main issue I see with this is that its a product that has essentially very little to no market.

The vegetarians are happy eating vegetables, and generally speaking, don't really eat burgers/haven't eaten one in a long time, so how close it is to a real burger doesn't matter.

Non vegetarians, don't really have an issue eating meat, and generally won't pay extra for not eating meat, in fucking burgers (and extra in this case can also mean time). And, anyone that has tasted a burger can tell the difference (though, I might be biased because I'm a super taster, so).

If this was, say, a Prime Rib replacement that was much cheaper, sure, I'd see it swinging, but, we've seen both the ""save the planet"" and ""healthier"" argument many times, and the stuff attached to it, fail.

Ultra far left woke types are not generally a market that can really sustain anything.

And, there are contaminants in the burgers that make many people uncomfortable (like, roundup, which is in a ton of lawsuits in the states for giving people cancer).

So, who knows. I see a huge possibility here that someone is going to get sick with something, and the whole thing will plummet (for an example of this happening, look at the Gluten stuff a couple years ago).",2019-07-07 16:33:48,-4,Futurology,Tutsks,comment,"Plant-Based Meat Is About to Get Cheaper Than Animal Flesh, Report Says"

Flexitarians are people who aren’t giving into temptation, but rather make the conscious choice to eat meat occasionally.

"You can get a huge amount of the environmental and health benefits from just cutting out red meat.

For example, the carbon footprint per person of the following diets:

* Meat Lover: 3.3
* Average: 2.5
* No Beef: 1.9
* Vegetarian: 1.7
* Vegan: 1.5

The difference between Average and Vegetarian is 0.8, but you can get 0.6 better than Average just by cutting out Beef.  Going from ""No Beef"" all the way to fully Vegan only has an additional 0.4 benefit, so the biggest and easiest improvement to your diets carbon  footprint is just cutting out the red meat.

"Can't we just call this ""Default"" instead of giving it a stupid fucking name for something that has been the standard since God or Allah or Steven Hawking's ghost created omnivores on this planet? 

Like, that's literally called a human diet. Meat when available and substitute the rest with vegetables and plants. I can't use the word ""literally"" enough, that's literally how any meat/plant eating animal works, you eat meat once in a while or less often than plants. Humans would eat meat once or twice a week and the rest of the time is a protein/fiber/plant rich diet until meat is available. 

The opposite of this is called the ""American Diet"", where you eat meat because it's cheaper than broccoli. It's cheaper to buy a whole burger than a side salad with 1 piece of tomato. There's a big difference between meat eaters and Americans. Americans are sick because food is a product, not a basic human right. Guns are, but health and food and clean water are not, but at least we have guns to protect our right to.. oh wait, nvm.

It's best to cut back from the perpsective of meat quality, animal welfare and the environment. 

It's a win-win cos you get good meat when you want it. Animals don't get to live in tiny coops which makes the overall meat richer and provides greater quality to the meat.

* getting off of prescription drugs like omeprezol, atenalol, and metformin. 

* pissing off vegans by telling people it's ok to have meat, just as long as 95% of your calaries come from plants that are minimally-processed (for example, brown rice = good, rice crackers from a cellophane bag = bad).

"I ate nothing but raw veggies and fruits for 8 - 10 months. I can't remember the exact amount of time and it took a while for me to get used to others things outside of that diet. 

I ran and exercised every day. I had so much energy that I essentially didn't know what to do with it. When I was on that diet and doing all that excising stuff, it was the best I'd ever felt in my life. Wanted to enjoy the city more so I broke my diet in order to try everything out. Now I constantly feel like garbage and I fear going back on the diet because of how monotonous it was.

Truth be told, once you really start eating healthy, roughly three or so weeks, you develop this odd thing where you just want to get full. Essentially you just eat to satisfy your hunger. It was super cheap and easy. 

I think it's the way to go, but I still believe in eating meat (chicken, turkey, fish).

"My wife and I don't completely restrict any foods, we like to eat meat. We became more health and longevity minded about 5 years ago and have moved further away from a diet that's heavy in meats, especially heavily processed meats.  

We used to eat fast food daily, processed and boxed everything, freezer meal everything and we've slowly changed. Nowadays we'll have completely vegetarian meals for 5 days straight without even realizing we've had no meat. If we are having something like a burger, we still buy whole meat and grind it ourselves. Everything we eat is just more mindful of what it is, where it comes from, and how processed it is before we touch it.

"Militant veganism is an inherently dishonest movement. 
All of the supposed benefits of veganism are consistent with reduced meat consumption/production. The environment can support sustainable agriculture. (I'm aware that's a tautology) There are healthy animal-based products, so veganism isn't necessary for health reasons either. 

Strict veganism isn't consistent with environmentalism or public health. If such a philosophy were, it would accept animal products farmed ethically and consumed efficiently. Not accepting these practices is only consistent with a person who's feelings get hurt when they think about an animal dying. It's not a morally or ethically wrong mindset, but it's useless for the purpose of improving our societies.  This is why support for veganism ranges from protest shopping to outright terrorism instead of supporting improved agriculture and distribution practices.",2018-03-14 18:58:15,1,todayilearned,oridia,comment,TIL Flexitarianism / Semi-Vegitarianism is a movement trying to encourage people to eat more plant based diets without going strict anti-meat etc.

The problem is that vegetarianism (and more so veganism) is very in your face about their presence and movement. Most people don’t respond well to extremists screaming in their face telling them their lifestyle is wrong.

Also, a bit of advice for people looking for meat-free meals; Make dishes that are intended to be meat-free like; shakshuka, ratatouille, soups, stuffed peppers, curry chickpeas, etc. Don't make meat dishes sans-meat, or use meat substitutes.

In a way its the best of both worlds, I can eat whatever I want, which is mainly vegetarian, and I can still occasionally have meat. The worst part about being vegetarian/vegan is going out to family or work gatherings and having people offer you food, and you have to turn them down.

"I follow a flexitarian diet. My approach is that I eat meat when someone offers it to me such as when I am a guest at a friend’s home or during the holidays. I think if the food has already been prepared then it is a kind gesture to accept it as a guest and I don’t like the idea of food going to waste. 

I also eat meat when I travel although I do try to do research about the naturally vegetarian or vegan options of a particular culture or region. I eat meat every once in a while out of the blue when I crave it. I usually crave it when I am really really hungry and just want something to eat. Most of the time after I eat it I am a little disappointed because it is never as good as I remember or expect it to be.  Also after I eat it my digestion feels sluggish and that also puts me off. 

When I go to specific events where there is fun junk food that I don’t usually eat such as a hot dog at a baseball game, sometimes I will just go for it because it feels like part of the experience. 

I think it is easier for me to take this approach because my motivations for not eating meat are for the environment and for my health mostly. I understand it wouldn’t necessarily make as much sense for someone that doesn’t eat meat for moral reasons.

"I was vegan from 1989 until 2004. I worked in an office next to a really wonderful Chinese buffet and at that point started eating fish again, simply because it was a good cheap lunch. After that I brought in and out and started eating whatever was available or offered, and really began to enjoy eating in restaurants again.

Time passed and I develop some health issues, namely elevated blood sugar levels and the doctor suggested I needed to drop potatoes corn sugar and rice from my diet. Since I already didn't consume any detectable amounts of sugar, the rest was a matter of mental adjustment. I gave up all those starchy carbs, every starch pretty much except for legumes, about 2 1/2 years ago.

Just this month I have gone vegan again, although this time of course the starchy carbs are still out. It hasn't been all that difficult, but if I visit with family and they are serving something that isn't vegan, I may eat a little of it. No sense in being rude, the animal is already dad, and a little bacon or eggs or whatever here or there isn't going to kill me. And I still do need a source of natural B 12.

So I consider myself a starch free vegan with no Nazi vegan attitude.

Their version wasn't *derived* from peanuts, but apparently it's one of the substances that *some* of the people with peanut allergies react to. And to me, it made the burger taste a little like peanuts. It wasn't off-putting, though.

Impossible meats are much better. I have had the grounds, the meatballs, and the patties. They taste, smell, and cook like meat much better than Beyond.

"Will definitely give it a shot.

I think that there's a niche here that might explode a bit:  hunters.

A wild deer, elk, antelope is very lean.  Typically when processing the meat, a hunter or the processor will add some beef suet or other fat to the ground meat to make it hold together / cook more like what you'd expect.  Some hunters don't because they don't like the taste, the cost, OR because you're throwing some factory-farmed whatever into your totally clean grass-fed meat.

So, this last year instead of suet, I used some of their ground beef to mix in, and it really, really sang in an unexpected way.  You didn't have that clash of elk + beef taste since it's a bit more neutral, it's plant-based and not some jacked-up fat form who knows where, and it provides the same or better holding-together power for the ground meat.  It really was a win-win-win all around for me, now a number of my friends are planning on doing the same thing next year.",2021-04-27 23:05:21,24,Futurology,,comment,"Beyond Meat just unveiled the third iteration of their plant-based Meat product and its reported to be cheaper for consumers, have better nutritional profile and be meatier than ever."

"Of course the company and industry are going to be pruning this comment section pretty well, but, here's a couple points in the event that I'm not shadow deleted.

We're supposed to believe that getting complete proper nutrition from vegan sources is cheaper than getting what nutrition there is when meat is a part of our diet. ""Better nutrition profile"", ""meatier"", and the fact that this costs over double the cost of meat even though veggie burgers have been on the market for at least about half a century, seem to put this in question.

Even billion dollar fast food giants that wish to add filler to their ground beef burgers are unable to replicate what is the goodness of beef.

Wouldn't we all love to believe vegetables could replace meat. But not all nutrition comes down to the macros, carbs, protein and fats; not all fats are the same, not all carbs are the same, not all proteins are the same. Not all nutrition comes down to generalized macros plus a few generic lettered vitamins and couple minerals/salts. There's the rub.

And this as a cure for our meaty ways would almost be believable, except for how all the vegan content on reddit is either attached to pure battiness, self back-patting, and false victimhood, or looks exactly like how a company would try covertly to push their investment.",2021-04-27 22:53:13,20,Futurology,existenceisssfutile,comment,"Beyond Meat just unveiled the third iteration of their plant-based Meat product and its reported to be cheaper for consumers, have better nutritional profile and be meatier than ever."

Is there a scientific concern replacing meat, a substance which man has eaten since it's genesis, to a essentially manufactured product?

Could there be unintended consequences from switching to plant-meat from meat-meat?

On a personal note, I just find it easier to eat less meat.  Although I still use meat product like chicken stock I eat meat-meat like once or twice a week now.

"The part in the headline where it says better nutrition profile is completely false. I studied nutrition and sports science and have degrees based on optimal nutrition and nutrition for optimal performance. The problem with this go green hype these days is we’re to focused on micronutrients rather than the macronutrients. Macronutrients is the reason we’re alive. You need them to survive and your body to function. No way around it. You don’t need carbs but it’s your bodies preferred source of energy and hydrate many cells and muscles with water. Which leads me to not believe the no carb diet either. Sorry but unfortunately we all have a general metabolic rate in which gages how much energy one burns in a day (24 hours). Varies based on activity level. Easy way for dummies or 101 is take your weight and multiply it by 15 and that’s roughly how many calories you burn a day. That’s with moderately active person. If your sedative multiply by 13 and if your a professional athlete and workout every day extreme amounts multiply by 17. This is a quick way if you don’t have access to a resting metabolic calorie calculator online or anywhere else. But. When you find that out eat less than that to lose weight and more to gain. I start with 500 calories less than maintenance  and there’s 3500 calories in a pound so I’d you ate 500 less calories than you burn a day that’s a pound of weight loss a week . Healthy start don’t go to low because your body will start to go survival mode and hold onto everything and then you will be angry lol but anyways now ppl say I thought sugar was the answer because that stores as fat. Yes and no. If you eat less than you burn your body can’t store anything. But don’t eat twinkies all day even if you end up with less calories than your maintenance because I’m going to get fancy right now. If you have a pair shaped body. You can lose weight and just look like a smaller pair lol if your eating less but your carbs and sugar are to high and not enough protein for muscle tissue and bone density and not enough fat for production of vital hormones , your going to lose weight but your body composition will remain higher in fat. Sugar spikes insulin which tells your body to either store fat if your eating more than you burn or hold onto it if your eating less than you burn. The key is to always keep protein on the higher end roughly .7 to .8 grams per pound of body weight to ensure you hold onto your muscle and lean body mass for the most ideal and sexy weight loss you can have. 

The reason carbs get a bad rap is because eating a surplus of calories , your body has the easiest time turning carbs to fat first. But if you have your protein in check and a good amount of healthy fats (eggs, meat, nuts ), filling in the rest with some fun food or carbs isn’t going impact you as much and will keep you sane and happy lol

Now, back to the main point . You can’t survive on just micronutrients (vitamins ). First and most important you need a good macronutrient ratio. High protein, moderate fat and moderate carbs preferably sugar free carbs if possible. You will attain plenty of micronutrient through your food without needing to eat salad all day or veggie patties lol although I’m not saying don’t eat your greens because they do have a good content of vitamin A,K and fiber usually. But focus on the core first then you can add your salads or whatever you prefer. 

These people that are just eating greens and salads all day are realizing they feel miserable and look flat and sluggish and it makes perfect sense of why. There’s no protein or fats barely in that diet. And protein and fats are the only 2 you literally need for your body to function haha

Last, studies show that dietary cholesterol like in eggs and red meat do not raise your cholesterol but actually it’s to much sugar and overeating forming triglycerides in your blood to build that will lead to high cholesterol. Eggs have the good cholesterol (HDL). This can actually lower cholesterol as well as red meat actually contains good cholesterol . For us men, testosterone production is governed by cholesterol . Cholesterol creates the testosterone in the body. We need it! 

All in all if it comes from the ground or an animal, it’s your most optimal choice for health. Just like the old days and farmers diet. It’s back to the basics. Good protein source like meat or eggs or even milk with a clean carb source like potatoes or rice and maybe a salad with it. 

Most of these fads were a way for people to make money off of uneducated people in the nutrition side of things and making them believe in that a certain macro is bad or this and that so you follow the program and they make money off of you. It used to be fats now it’s carbs and blah blah blah. Just have common sense and be conscious before your meals .",2021-04-28 05:28:31,6,Futurology,Rmatthew2495,comment,"Beyond Meat just unveiled the third iteration of their plant-based Meat product and its reported to be cheaper for consumers, have better nutritional profile and be meatier than ever."

"A lot of people are commenting that Impossible burgers are better.

[It is because they use plant-based blood, basically. They literally discovered a novel process on how to extract certain genes from soy plants, and then ferment them with genetically engineered yeast cells to produce leghemoboglin.](https://impossiblefoods.com/heme)

The only competitive edge that Beyond Meat has is that they don't use soy... but that's literally it.

The west has a ridiculous fear off soy that is a whole other story.

I wonder if Impossible Foods has a patent on their process and technology? If they do, then there's no way anyone can catch up, especially Beyond Meat.

Ultimately this is what will kill the animal ag industry.

"The only Beyond meat I've actually liked so far have been the brats. I'd eat those any day. The rest has just been too obviously fake but trying to be meat. So I'm looking forward to seeing what their new recipe does.

I eat plant based meat sometimes anyway, but... if they can get the juiciness part sorted out I can go (mostly) vegetarian for sure.

Store frozen. Ok. But you can’t cook from frozen. Ok. So pull some out to thaw. Ok.

Nobody bought the damn things. Like ok, some people did, but we’d pull 5. A week later, we’d throw out 4. And you can’t pull out just 1 because that’s insane. Sometimes we’d sell 2. One week we sold 4.

So we always had to pull out 5, just in case. And 90% of the time, we threw them out.

Waste of everybody's time. And seriously, I don’t know of any place that had success with them. I’m sure they exist, but I don’t know of any.

Impossible definitely got better recently but saying it’s anywhere close to tasting like actual meat is a stretch. It has such a distinct texture and taste that isn’t the texture and taste of meat. Exciting prospect for people who enjoy it but calling it “meatier” I’m dubious about at best. I guess if it tastes at all like meat then it would be meatier than it is currently but it’s not a high bar.,2021-04-28 08:13:15,0,Futurology,,comment,"Beyond Meat just unveiled the third iteration of their plant-based Meat product and its reported to be cheaper for consumers, have better nutritional profile and be meatier than ever."

Seems like, for the short term, it would be a fair compromise for both cost and environmental impact.

In the long term it could be used to ween people off of beef. Start with 50/50 and then 70/30 plant/beef.

"If this product was serious...
1) wouldn't continue to market itself with totally bogus 'environmental' advocacy pieces ignoring American weaponized Texas soybean/rice cash crop to glut the markets that use it so that THEY have a lower price thus 'rape more earth' (like the Rainforest in Brazil! and mangroves in SE asia) to just keep price steady. So how is a product whose cost is near zero due to farm subsidies  profitable?  The transportation is where the profit is because the carbon tax offsets transport for GREEN products...it's a disincentive to regionally sustained food models that would reduce overall CO2 particulates which should be the only reason for the claim as anything else is just deceptive marketing.

2) So the market entry price is higher than meat, but the revamping of the product contents will bring it into competitive range of a comparative meat product?  Huh...that's like saying the weather profile predictives model for my north orchard Honeycrisp apples will increase the sugar content by fall harvest so the retail price is pretty close to Valcenia oranges.

DOES IT?

Because all you get now is a piece of food that wasn't an animal RECENTLY and who's supply chain kills off wildlife, airidizes farm lands, kills bees, spreads pesticides, and creates a massive unrecyclable mess between transport emissions and finally in the hands of the consumer who throws away all that packaging, unable to recycle it.

"I can't stop thinking about [this quote last week about an investor who is betting on a carbon tax in our future, and investing accordingly](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/11/magazine/climate-change-exxon-renewable-energy.html):

> Grantham’s fund is going long on lithium and copper, which he believes will form the vascular system of future renewable-powered supergrids. His confidence derives from an odd and specific conviction that “sooner or later, there will be a carbon tax,” and much of the market capitalization of the leading oil and gas companies will be erased. “You have a certainty,” he said. “It will happen. Or we’ll be on our way to a failed civilization.”

> It took me a moment to process what this meant. **Grantham was saying that a bet on a future carbon tax was a sure thing because the absence of a carbon tax meant civilizational catastrophe. If he were right, he could make billions. If he were wrong, it wouldn’t matter, because the world would be on fire.** “Perfectly fine logic,” Grantham said, as the old radiators gurgled around him.

"For those of you that say they can't economically justify paying an extra couple bucks for plant-based meats:

&#x200B;

Here's the average approximate cost for one pound of ground beef

\-14.8 Kgs of CO2 gas

\-873.6 Liters of water

\-45.6 Megajoules energy used

\-15.2 Meters\^2 land used

&#x200B;

And for one pound of plant based meat

\-1.6 Kg of CO2 gas

\-24.4 Megajoules energy used

\-4.4 Liters of water

\-1.2 Meters\^2 land used

&#x200B;

So by paying like 2 bucks extra you could cut your CO2 emissions by around 90%, water emissions by 99%, land impact by 93%, and energy use by 46%.

&#x200B;

Additionally, if you're buying the inexpensive chuck at your local grocery, it came from a factory farm. That's why its inexpensive. Actual free range meat is more expensive than plant-based alternatives.

&#x200B;

If you're one of those redditors that claims to hate animal cruelty or care about the environment then this should mean something to you. Even if you switch to plant based meats for just a fraction of your diet it makes a huge impact. If you publicly anguish over climate change and animal cruelty but aren't willing to spend like 2 extra dollars to vastly reduce your impact, then you're a hypocrite.

"This is all bullshit unless and until fake meat satisfies both of the following:

1. It is cheaper than the cheapest real meat, such as ground beef and costco chicken, both of which are $2-$3/lb. Beyond meat right now is about $12/lb. At those prices I can buy premium high end steak or seafood at Costco.

2. It is equal to or superior in nutritional value to chicken and lean beef. Good luck with that. Vegetable proteins are usually trash quality, with soy being the main offender used as a cheap, low-quality filler protein. 

Unless both of these things are true, with fake meat being superior on price AND nutritional quality, fake meat is going to remain the domain of hipster vegetarians.",2019-04-26 18:36:48,8,Futurology,dekachin5,comment,Beyond Meat is going public.

"You'd have to be blisteringly naive or incredibly ignorant to think that plant based foods are going to some how fix our food system.

If you think McDonalds and friends swapping to vegan food is going to make them use less waste, and source their products sustainably, you clearly havent been paying attention.

These companies don't care. They will follow demand, but they will not incur the costs of doing business sustainably. 

Just look at Palm Oil, Tea, Coffee, Almonds and other non meat crops that destroying the environments they are being produced in. 

These companies tear down the forests, upend the natural ecosystem, plant shit tons of whatever the fuck they want on them, destroy the soil, and move on.

It doesn't matter if its meat or veggie, the thing that needs to change isn't the substance in our food, it's the driving exploitative behavior of these insanely rich corporations and our insane over eating, use of plastics, and disposable littering culture. 

Trying to replace meat in the system isn't the solution, the system itself is what's causing the problem and meat is a symptom of the greater problem.

Replacing meat to reduce livestock animal suffering? Great, but it doesn't stop the suffering in the wild that is caused by the unsustainable exploitative farming practices of consume the land, leave it barren, move on, plant more food, because the money said so.

Because you can be damn sure that McDonalds and friends don't give a flying fuck about the orangutans and Tucans, when all they want to see is a raise in stock prices.

"Considering that we evolved to eat meat over hundreds of thousands of years (and maybe evolved because we ate meat), what will it mean for human beings to begin eating a diet of highly processed plants?  What will happen to our health when these nutritionally inferior foods push out what we’ve evolved to eat over those ages of evolution?

How can a diet of highly processed food be in any way good for human beings?  Why should any solution to our food system rely on fake food instead of what we’ve been eating all along?

Also, why don’t people ever talk about the destructive nature of plant agriculture?  Plant based diet have this image of being for the environment, but how is destroying a biodiverse piece of land and planting a mono crop, which requires pesticides and fossil-fuel derived nitrogen fertilizers to exist (and destroys the land), good for the environment? Sure, you’re not killing an animal to eat it, but you’ve destroyed a whole ecosystem (as well as all the animals on it).  That field that grows your wheat used to have a whole variety of birds, mice, moles, voles, small mammals of all kinds, and insects of all kinds (bees, for example), but no one cares about those.

So much of the plant foods we eat are flown in from other countries.  Few people seem to care about the environmental impact of those avocados or bananas they eat, of those strawberries they get in the middle of winter, of all that food that grows nowhere near them and the damage they caused in some land far away.

"If we switch to plant based meat, then could it have a long-term impact on the human body? I know that we need to save the environment and animals and insects are going extinct every day due our eating and living habits (we are like locusts and destroy everything we touch), but humans have eaten meat since the time of the caveman and it’s clearly kept us alive and perpetuated our race. 

Can we really get everything we need from just plants? 

Considering how fast some animals breed (I’m Australian so it’s crucial for us to kill Kangaroos as they’re in the double digit millions and eating all vegetation that other animals survive on), it would be a bad thing to let them run amuck and keep breeding unabaited.

As little as some people would like to admit, humans killing and eating some animals is good for the environment and keeps our bodies healthy with the nutrients we need. 

I’m wondering what impact not killing and eating animals would have on other animals too, especially the carnivores.

Do people expect ranchers to just stop and start growing this stuff? I don't see that happening. 

Most of the farmable land is currently being farmed for other essential foods (corn/barley/wheat), and the land that isn't is being used for cattle. And most of that cattle land is cattle because it can't grow anything significant. Growing seasons in cattle country can be as short as 2 months, or at longest around 4-5 (around 100 days for Montana, Wyoming, Idaho). If they could grow anything there....they'd be growing it.

"I’m not sure now much people think this will “fix”. In the US all agriculture only accounts for 9% of emissions and meat accounts for 40% of this.

Look, I WANT to move to plant based meat substitutes or artificial meat. I am excited. But this notion this will “fix” the worlds problems is ridiculous.

The other samples were aged, high quality beef with a slightly rancid taste of aged beef.

"My symptoms are brought on by eating gluten, beans, and other plant material. I can eat milk, cheese, and meat products with the exception of pork with no problem. 

I was raised a vegetarian up until I was 21 years old and I was a very sick child. Once I started to eat meat low and behold my recurrent sickness  vanished. My ibs hit when I turned 40 years of age. 

All of the  research I have done on this subject talks to genetics being the major player here and not bacteria counts in the stomach. 

Most suffers of IBS start to suffer at the age of 40. Now if it was a matter of bacterial counts shouldn’t I be able to do a round of antibiotics and kill off everything then take probiotics and replenish my counts? 

I also noticed that after years of taking Advil for chronic back pain my problems started.

"Review:

Honesty its ok and over rated.  I was excited to try it and found it at Safeway for $7.99.

The  texture is comparable to beef however the taste is nothing like beef.  Slap it in a burger and I get a weird after taste without seasoning.   I had to heavily season it just to make it taste better.  

While cooking it on a nonstick pan it had a odd smell to it and seemed greasy after I finished cooking it.

Then I tried making taco beyond meat with lots of seasoning, I couldn’t tell the difference and it came out rather good.  It was really easy to break up into small pieces like ground up beef.

The price $7.99 is too expensive and I can find other brands for $3.99 or less. 

Protein content, 10g per patty is not enough considering 13g from a Boca burger and Im sure there’s more protein in Buffalo meat.

I haven’t tried it in Spaghetti but I’m planning to try it next week.

Flavor: 
Buffalo meat 10
Steak burger meat 9.5
Regular Hamburger meat 9
Boca Burger 7
Beyond Burger 5

I would note Boca Burger isn’t a good substitution for meat as its more like a chicken burger.

I would recommend trying it so that you can have your own opinion.  

Pro: Works well as a taco meat replacement
Greasy like a burger, this could be a con but what meat isn’t a greasy?

Con:  too expensive
Not enough protein
Doesn’t taste good in a hamburger
You have to over season it for a decent flavor
Smells while cooking



Its not a meat replacement for a hamburger but works well in Tacos.  

Its way over priced and over hyped.

I plan to try it at Carls Jr and Burger King.

"Call me crazy, and I may very well be, but I do not trust an entity whose purpose is to make money to grow food in a lab for me and ensure that it is healthy and nutritious.  And if production of meat moves to labs, can we really trust these same entities to fairly supply and price the meat? Look at what has happened to the price of insulin, for example.  

With regards to the environment, I think meat production is a scapegoat.  In the US, Agriculture accounts for 9% of emissions (that’s for both meat and plant products).  The big emitters is greenhouse gasses are transportation - 29%, electricity - 28%, and industry - 22%. (These numbers are from the epa).  If we want to reduce greenhouse emissions, we should start with the biggest producers.  So yes, let’s increase agricultural efficiency, but let’s not sacrifice health along the way.  

There are however lots of countries with really inefficient meat production, and if we could make those operations as efficient as in the US, that would help globally.  There also seem to be ways of raising livestock which can restore land, help increase carbon sequestration, and water retention in the soil. I would love to see more of that happen.",2019-04-26 20:15:21,0,Futurology,IamTheCattle,comment,Beyond Meat is going public. Investors are betting on a new future for food.
